# The Cognition Stack  -  Semax + Selank + Dihexa for Mental Performance and Focus

Imagine a cognitive enhancer that combines three powerful peptides, each targeting a different pathway in the brain. That's the cognition stack  -  a synergistic trio designed to boost focus, memory, and mental clarity.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **Three complementary mechanisms**  -  Semax (BDNF/NGF), Selank (GABA/anxiolytic), Dihexa (HGF/synaptogenesis)
> - **Nasal vs. subcutaneous**  -  Optimal administration routes for each peptide
> - **Cycle length**  -  4-8 weeks with 2-4 week breaks recommended
> - **Side effect profile**  -  Generally mild (nasal irritation, temporary headache)
> - **Cost breakdown**  -  ~$120-200/month depending on sources

## What Is the Cognition Stack?

The cognition stack combines three nootropic peptides with distinct but complementary mechanisms:

| Peptide | Primary Mechanism | Secondary Effects |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Semax** | BDNF/NGF upregulation | Enhanced focus, neuroprotection |
| **Selank** | GABA modulation | Reduced anxiety, immune support |
| **Dihexa** | HGF/c-Met activation | Memory formation, synaptogenesis |

This combination targets multiple cognitive domains simultaneously:

- **Attention and focus** (Semax)
- **Stress resilience** (Selank)
- **Memory formation** (Dihexa)

For individual peptide profiles, see our guides on [Semax](/articles/semax-nootropic-peptide-guide) and [Dihexa](/articles/dihexa-nootropic-peptide-guide).

## How the Cognition Stack Works

### Semax: The BDNF Booster

Semax is a synthetic analog of ACTH(4-10) with unique properties:

- **Increases BDNF**  -  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, important for neuroplasticity
- **Upregulates NGF**  -  Nerve growth factor, supporting neuron health
- **Modulates melanocortin receptors**  -  Enhancing alertness and focus

**Observed effects:**

- **Sharpened focus** within 15-30 minutes (nasal administration)
- **Improved task persistence**  -  Reduced mental fatigue during prolonged work
- **Neuroprotective effects**  -  Shown in ischemia models ([Skvortsova et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15179829/))

### Selank: The Anxiolytic Stabilizer

Selank is a heptapeptide derived from tuftsin with GABAergic activity:

- **Modulates GABA transmission**  -  Reducing anxiety without sedation
- **Regulates immune function**  -  Via effects on cytokines
- **Enhances serotonin metabolism**  -  Contributing to mood stability

**Key benefits:**

- **Smooths cognitive edges**  -  Counters potential overstimulation from Semax
- **Improves stress resilience**  -  Particularly under pressure
- **May enhance sleep quality**  -  When taken earlier in the day

### Dihexa: The Memory Molecule

Dihexa is a small molecule peptide mimetic with unique properties:

- **Activates HGF/c-Met pathway**  -  Promoting synaptogenesis
- **Crosses blood-brain barrier**  -  Unlike native HGF
- **Enhances long-term potentiation**  -  The cellular basis of memory

> **Key Finding:** In animal models, Dihexa restored cognitive function in Alzheimer's-like conditions ([Benoist et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24361175/)).

## Dosing Protocol

### Administration Routes

| Peptide | Best Route | Bioavailability |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Semax** | Intranasal | ~60-70% |
| **Selank** | Intranasal | ~50-60% |
| **Dihexa** | Subcutaneous | ~80%+ |

### Recommended Doses

| Peptide | Daily Dose | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Semax** | 400-800 mcg | 1-2x/day | Morning/early afternoon |
| **Selank** | 300-600 mcg | 1-2x/day | As needed for stress |
| **Dihexa** | 2-4 mg | 1x/day | Morning administration |

### Cycle Length

- **4-8 weeks** of continuous use
- **2-4 week breaks** between cycles
- **Longer breaks (6-8 weeks)** recommended after 3 consecutive cycles

## Side Effects

Generally mild and transient:

### Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Management |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Nasal irritation** | Common | Use saline spray post-dose |
| **Mild headache** | Occasional | Hydration, reduce dose |
| **Increased alertness** | Common | Avoid late-day dosing |

### Rare

- **Blood pressure changes** (usually mild elevation with Semax)
- **Vivid dreams** (particularly with Dihexa)
- **Temporary anxiety** (if Selank dose is too low)

## Who Benefits Most?

Based on current usage patterns:

- **Students**  -  For exam preparation and focus
- **Knowledge workers**  -  Sustaining mental clarity during long projects
- **Age-related cognitive decline**  -  Potential neuroprotective benefits
- **Creative professionals**  -  Enhanced associative thinking

> **Important:** Not a substitute for sleep, nutrition, or professional medical advice.

## Cost Breakdown

Estimated monthly costs (research-grade sources):

| Peptide | Cost/Month | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Semax** | $40-60 | Nasal spray form |
| **Selank** | $30-50 | Nasal spray form |
| **Dihexa** | $50-90 | Subcutaneous vials |
| **Total** | **$120-200** | Varies by vendor |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly does the stack work?

- **Semax**: Effects noticeable within 15-30 minutes (nasal)
- **Selank**: Anxiolytic effects within 30-60 minutes
- **Dihexa**: Cumulative benefits over 1-2 weeks

### Can I use just one or two of these peptides?

Yes, but the synergy comes from combining all three. Semax+Selank is a common pairing for focus without anxiety.

### Is this stack safe long-term?

No long-term human studies exist. Cycling is recommended. Most users report good tolerance for 4-8 week cycles.

### How does this compare to pharmaceutical nootropics?

| Feature | Pharma Nootropics | Cognition Stack |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Mechanisms** | Single-target | Multi-pathway |
| **Side effects** | Often significant | Generally mild |
| **Cost** | $300+/month | $120-200/month |
| **Legal status** | Prescription | Research use |

### Can I stack this with other nootropics?

Common safe combinations:

- **Caffeine/L-theanine**  -  For additional focus
- **Lion's mane mushroom**  -  Additional NGF support
- **Omega-3s**  -  Foundation for brain health

## The Bottom Line

The cognition stack represents a sophisticated approach to cognitive enhancement  -  targeting focus, stress resilience, and memory formation simultaneously through distinct but complementary mechanisms.

While not a magic bullet, many users report significant improvements in mental performance, particularly during demanding cognitive work. The favorable safety profile and relatively low cost make it an attractive option for those exploring peptide-based nootropics.
