# Best Peptides for Muscle Growth: A Complete Ranking

Peptides won't replace food and training. Nothing will.

But if your nutrition and programming are already dialed in, certain peptides can push recovery, growth hormone output, and anabolic signaling in ways that natural lifters simply can't access. The trick is knowing which ones actually work, which ones are overhyped, and how to combine them intelligently.

This guide ranks every peptide commonly used for muscle growth, breaks down the mechanisms behind each, and gives you practical stacking and dosing frameworks.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **GH secretagogues** like CJC-1295 and ipamorelin are the foundation of most muscle-building peptide protocols
> - **Follistatin and myostatin inhibitors** offer the highest theoretical ceiling but carry the most unknowns
> - **BPC-157 and TB-500** don't directly build muscle but accelerate recovery, which indirectly supports growth
> - **MK-677** is technically not a peptide but gets grouped with them because it raises GH through a similar pathway
> - **Stacking matters** more than any single compound; the right combinations outperform solo use significantly

## Overall Ranking: Best Peptides for Muscle Growth

Before the deep breakdown, here's how everything stacks up.

| Rank | Compound | Category | Muscle Growth Potential | Evidence Level | Side Effect Risk |
|------|----------|----------|------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | **CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin** | GH secretagogue stack | High | Strong | Low-Moderate |
| 2 | **MK-677 (Ibutamoren)** | GH secretagogue (oral) | High | Strong | Moderate |
| 3 | **IGF-1 LR3** | Direct growth factor | Very High | Moderate | Moderate-High |
| 4 | **Tesamorelin** | GHRH analog | Moderate-High | Strong (FDA) | Low |
| 5 | **Follistatin 344** | Myostatin inhibitor | Very High (theoretical) | Weak | Unknown |
| 6 | **GHRP-6** | GH secretagogue | Moderate-High | Moderate | Moderate |
| 7 | **GHRP-2** | GH secretagogue | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| 8 | **BPC-157** | Recovery peptide | Indirect | Moderate | Low |
| 9 | **TB-500** | Recovery peptide | Indirect | Moderate | Low |

> **Important:** "Evidence level" reflects the quality and quantity of human research. Many peptides have strong animal data but limited clinical trials in humans specifically for muscle growth.

## GH Secretagogues: The Backbone of Peptide-Based Muscle Building

Growth hormone doesn't build muscle directly. It works through a cascade.

GH stimulates the liver to produce **IGF-1** (insulin-like growth factor 1), which then drives protein synthesis, satellite cell activation, and nitrogen retention. GH also improves fat oxidation and sleep quality, both of which support muscle gain indirectly.

GH secretagogues fall into two categories: **GHRH analogs** (which tell your pituitary to make more GH) and **ghrelin mimetics** (which amplify the release signal). Using one from each category together produces a synergistic pulse that's far larger than either alone.

### CJC-1295 (with DAC)

The most popular GHRH analog in the peptide space. CJC-1295 with DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) has a half-life of roughly **6-8 days**, which means it provides a sustained elevation of baseline GH rather than sharp pulses.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | GHRH analog with extended half-life |
| **Half-life** | 6-8 days (with DAC) |
| **Administration** | Subcutaneous injection, 1-2x per week |
| **Primary effect** | Sustained GH elevation |
| **Best paired with** | Ipamorelin or GHRP-2 |

CJC-1295 raised IGF-1 levels by **65-100%** in clinical studies, with effects lasting well beyond single dosing. That sustained elevation is what makes it attractive for muscle growth over time.

([Teichman et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16352683/))

For a full breakdown, see our [CJC-1295 DAC guide](/articles/cjc-1295-dac-guide).

### CJC-1295 (without DAC) / Mod GRF 1-29

The no-DAC version has a much shorter half-life (about **30 minutes**) and produces sharp GH pulses rather than sustained elevation. Many users prefer this because it more closely mimics natural GH release patterns.

- **Sharper GH pulses** but shorter duration
- **Requires more frequent dosing** (2-3x daily)
- **Less water retention** than the DAC version
- **Better for stacking** with ghrelin mimetics for acute pulses

### Ipamorelin

The cleanest ghrelin mimetic available. Ipamorelin stimulates GH release without significantly raising cortisol or prolactin, which is a problem with older ghrelin mimetics like GHRP-6.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Ghrelin mimetic (GH secretagogue) |
| **Half-life** | ~2 hours |
| **Administration** | Subcutaneous, 2-3x daily |
| **Cortisol increase** | Minimal |
| **Prolactin increase** | Minimal |
| **Hunger stimulation** | Mild |

> **Key Finding:** In a head-to-head comparison, ipamorelin produced GH pulses comparable to GHRP-6 but without the cortisol and prolactin spikes that make GHRP-6 problematic for long-term use. ([Raun et al., 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9849822/))

For a detailed look at the CJC-1295 and ipamorelin combination, check out our [tesamorelin and ipamorelin stack guide](/articles/tesamorelin-ipamorelin-stack-guide).

### Tesamorelin

Tesamorelin is the only GHRH analog with **FDA approval** (brand name Egrifta). It was approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy, specifically to reduce visceral fat.

- **FDA-approved** with established safety data in multi-year trials
- **Reduces visceral fat** by 15-18% in clinical trials
- **Increases IGF-1** without the sustained elevation that DAC provides
- **Improves body composition** across multiple endpoints

([Falutz et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17911227/))

The catch? Tesamorelin is prescription-only and expensive. But its safety profile is the most established of any GHRH analog.

### GHRP-6

The original ghrelin mimetic. GHRP-6 produces powerful GH pulses but comes with side effects that make it less popular than ipamorelin.

| Feature | GHRP-6 | Ipamorelin |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **GH release** | Strong | Strong |
| **Cortisol increase** | Significant | Minimal |
| **Prolactin increase** | Moderate | Minimal |
| **Hunger stimulation** | Intense | Mild |
| **Water retention** | More | Less |
| **Cost** | Lower | Moderate |

That intense hunger can be useful if you're in a hard bulk and struggling to eat enough. But for most people, the cortisol and prolactin elevation make GHRP-6 a worse choice than ipamorelin for extended protocols.

### GHRP-2

Sits between GHRP-6 and ipamorelin in terms of side effects. GHRP-2 produces slightly stronger GH pulses than ipamorelin but with more cortisol and prolactin output.

- **Stronger GH release** than ipamorelin per dose
- **Moderate cortisol increase** (less than GHRP-6, more than ipamorelin)
- **Moderate hunger stimulation** (less than GHRP-6)
- **Good mid-range option** if ipamorelin alone isn't producing enough response

### GH Secretagogue Comparison

| Compound | GH Pulse Strength | Cortisol Impact | Prolactin Impact | Hunger | Best For |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| **CJC-1295 (DAC)** | Sustained elevation | Low | Low | None | Baseline GH increase |
| **Mod GRF 1-29** | Moderate pulse | Low | Low | None | Pairing with ghrelin mimetics |
| **Ipamorelin** | Strong pulse | Minimal | Minimal | Mild | Clean GH protocol |
| **GHRP-2** | Strong-Very strong | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Maximizing GH output |
| **GHRP-6** | Very strong | Significant | Moderate | Intense | Hard bulking phases |
| **Tesamorelin** | Moderate pulse | Low | Low | None | FDA-approved protocol |

## MK-677 (Ibutamoren): The Oral Option

MK-677 is not a peptide. It's a small molecule ghrelin receptor agonist that you take orally. But it ends up in every peptide discussion because it raises GH and IGF-1 through the same ghrelin pathway as GHRP-6 and ipamorelin.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Non-peptide ghrelin mimetic |
| **Route** | Oral (capsule or liquid) |
| **Half-life** | ~24 hours |
| **IGF-1 increase** | 40-90% over baseline |
| **Duration** | Effects persist with daily dosing |
| **FDA Status** | Not approved |

The convenience of oral dosing makes MK-677 extremely popular. No reconstitution, no injections, no refrigeration required.

### Pros

- **Oral administration** removes the injection barrier entirely
- **Long half-life** means once-daily dosing
- **Sustained IGF-1 elevation** comparable to injectable GH secretagogues
- **Improves sleep quality** in multiple studies
- **Increases bone mineral density** over time

### Cons

- **Water retention and bloating** are common, especially at higher doses
- **Increased appetite** can be extreme in some users
- **Insulin resistance** with chronic use is a real concern
- **Elevated fasting blood glucose** reported in longer trials
- **Lethargy** in some users, particularly at doses above 20 mg

([Nass et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18981485/))

> **Important:** The insulin resistance issue is not trivial. Anyone using MK-677 for extended periods should monitor fasting glucose and HbA1c regularly. Combining it with a glucose disposal agent or metformin is common practice among experienced users.

## IGF-1 LR3: The Direct Approach

While GH secretagogues raise IGF-1 indirectly (GH signals the liver to make it), IGF-1 LR3 skips the middleman entirely. It's a modified version of IGF-1 with a much longer half-life than native IGF-1.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Modified insulin-like growth factor |
| **Half-life** | ~20-30 hours (vs. minutes for native IGF-1) |
| **Administration** | Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection |
| **Primary effect** | Direct activation of IGF-1 receptors |
| **Potency** | 2-3x more potent than native IGF-1 |

### How It Builds Muscle

IGF-1 LR3 acts directly on muscle tissue through several mechanisms:

- **Stimulates protein synthesis** via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
- **Activates satellite cells** which fuse with existing muscle fibers, creating new myonuclei
- **Promotes hyperplasia** (new muscle fiber formation), not just hypertrophy
- **Improves nutrient partitioning** toward muscle rather than fat

That satellite cell activation is the key differentiator. Most anabolic compounds only make existing fibers bigger (hypertrophy). IGF-1 LR3 may actually increase the number of muscle cells, which represents a permanent structural change.

### The Risks

IGF-1 LR3 is more potent than GH secretagogues but carries more risk:

- **Hypoglycemia** if not timed properly around meals
- **Potential for organ growth** at higher doses (intestines in particular)
- **Theoretical cancer concern** due to cell proliferation effects
- **Minimal human safety data** for muscle-building applications

> **Important:** IGF-1 LR3 is not for beginners. The risk profile is meaningfully higher than GH secretagogues, and the dosing window between "effective" and "problematic" is narrower.

---

## Follistatin and Myostatin Inhibitors: The Frontier

Myostatin is a protein that limits muscle growth. It acts as a biological brake. Remove that brake, and muscle grows far beyond normal limits.

This isn't theoretical. Myostatin-knockout animals (Belgian Blue cattle, bully whippets, and genetically modified mice) develop **dramatically more muscle mass** without any training stimulus.

### Follistatin 344

Follistatin binds to and neutralizes myostatin (and activin A). Follistatin 344 is the synthetic version most commonly available through research peptide suppliers.

- **Mechanism:** Binds myostatin, preventing it from limiting muscle growth
- **Animal data:** Impressive. Mice treated with follistatin show significant muscle mass increases.
- **Human data:** Extremely limited. Gene therapy trials using follistatin for muscular dystrophy have shown promise, but injectable follistatin data in healthy humans is sparse.
- **Stability concerns:** Follistatin is a large, fragile protein. Whether injectable versions survive reconstitution and actually reach target tissues in meaningful concentrations is genuinely uncertain.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Theoretical ceiling** | Very high |
| **Current evidence** | Mostly animal models |
| **Practical reliability** | Questionable |
| **Cost** | High |
| **Risk profile** | Largely unknown |

> **Bottom line:** Follistatin represents the most exciting theoretical approach to muscle growth in the peptide space. But the gap between theory and reliable practice is still wide. If you're considering it, understand that you're operating well outside established research.

### ACE-031 and Other Myostatin Approaches

Several pharmaceutical companies have attempted to develop myostatin inhibitors. Acceleron's ACE-031 reached clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy before being shelved due to safety concerns (nosebleeds, gum bleeding, skin issues related to effects on blood vessel formation).

This highlights a key issue: myostatin doesn't only regulate muscle. Blocking it has downstream effects that aren't fully understood yet.

## BPC-157 and TB-500: The Recovery Peptides

Neither BPC-157 nor TB-500 will directly add slabs of muscle. That's not what they do.

What they do is accelerate recovery from training, heal injured tissues faster, and reduce inflammation. For someone training hard enough to actually need peptide support, that recovery capacity translates directly into more productive training sessions and fewer forced deload weeks.

### BPC-157

A synthetic peptide derived from a protective protein found in human gastric juice. BPC-157 has extensive animal research showing accelerated healing of tendons, ligaments, muscles, and even the gut lining.

- **Tendon and ligament repair** is the most studied application
- **Angiogenesis** (new blood vessel formation) improves nutrient delivery to damaged tissue
- **Anti-inflammatory effects** reduce training-related inflammation
- **Gut healing** can improve nutrient absorption in people with GI issues

([Chang et al., 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21030672/))

See our full [BPC-157 guide](/articles/bpc-157-complete-guide) for dosing and protocols.

### TB-500

TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) is a naturally occurring peptide involved in tissue repair and cell migration. It works through different mechanisms than BPC-157, which is why the two are often stacked together.

- **Upregulates actin** which is essential for cell migration and wound healing
- **Reduces inflammation** through different pathways than BPC-157
- **Promotes new blood vessel growth** similar to BPC-157
- **Systemic effects** meaning it doesn't need to be injected at the injury site

For the complete breakdown, read our [TB-500 guide](/articles/tb-500-complete-guide).

### BPC-157 vs. TB-500

| Feature | BPC-157 | TB-500 |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Primary mechanism** | Growth factor modulation | Actin upregulation |
| **Best for** | Tendon, ligament, GI repair | Muscle, cardiac, systemic repair |
| **Injection site** | Local or subcutaneous | Subcutaneous (systemic) |
| **Half-life** | ~4 hours | ~24 hours (estimated) |
| **Dosing frequency** | 1-2x daily | 2-3x per week |
| **Stack together?** | Yes, complementary mechanisms | Yes, complementary mechanisms |

> **Key Finding:** The BPC-157 and TB-500 combination is one of the most commonly used recovery stacks in the peptide community. While no human clinical trial has tested them together, the distinct mechanisms of action provide a reasonable rationale for combination use.

## Stacking Strategies: Putting It All Together

Individual peptides are fine. Smart combinations are better. Here are the most common stacking approaches organized by goal.

### Stack 1: The Standard GH Protocol

The most popular and well-tolerated muscle growth stack.

| Component | Dose | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **CJC-1295 (no DAC)** | 100 mcg | 2-3x daily | GHRH signal |
| **Ipamorelin** | 200 mcg | 2-3x daily | GH release amplifier |

**Best timing:** Before bed and upon waking (fasted). The pre-sleep dose capitalizes on your natural nighttime GH pulse.

**Expected results:** Improved sleep quality within days. Body composition changes over 8-12 weeks. Gradual lean mass increases with proper training and nutrition.

### Stack 2: Maximum GH Output

For experienced users wanting more aggressive GH elevation.

| Component | Dose | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **CJC-1295 (DAC)** | 2 mg | 1x per week | Sustained baseline GH |
| **Ipamorelin** | 200-300 mcg | 2-3x daily | Pulsatile GH on top |
| **MK-677** | 12.5-25 mg | 1x daily (oral) | Additional sustained IGF-1 |

> **Important:** This is a high-output protocol. Monitor blood glucose, water retention, and joint issues. Not appropriate for first-time peptide users.

### Stack 3: Growth + Recovery

Combines muscle growth signaling with tissue repair.

| Component | Dose | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **CJC-1295 (no DAC)** | 100 mcg | 2-3x daily | GH release |
| **Ipamorelin** | 200 mcg | 2-3x daily | GH release |
| **BPC-157** | 250-500 mcg | 1-2x daily | Tissue repair |
| **TB-500** | 2-5 mg | 2x per week | Systemic recovery |

This is the go-to for lifters dealing with nagging injuries who want to train through them productively. The recovery peptides keep tissues healthy while the GH secretagogues drive anabolic signaling.

### Stack 4: Aggressive Muscle Building

The most potent combination. Higher risk, higher potential reward.

| Component | Dose | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **CJC-1295 (no DAC)** | 100 mcg | 3x daily | GH release |
| **GHRP-2** | 200 mcg | 3x daily | Strong GH pulses |
| **IGF-1 LR3** | 20-50 mcg | 1x daily | Direct growth factor |
| **MK-677** | 25 mg | 1x daily | Sustained IGF-1 |

> **Important:** This stack requires experience and monitoring. Blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and general blood work should be checked every 4-6 weeks. This is not a starting point.

## What About Natural Myostatin Reduction?

Before spending money on follistatin or exotic peptides, it's worth noting that resistance training itself reduces myostatin expression.

Heavy compound movements, particularly eccentrics, downregulate myostatin over time. This is one of the mechanisms behind "newbie gains" and why consistent training produces results that eventually plateau as the body recalibrates its myostatin setpoint.

Epicatechin (found in dark chocolate and green tea) has also shown modest myostatin-inhibiting effects in preliminary research, though the magnitude is far smaller than pharmaceutical approaches.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the single best peptide for muscle growth?

The **CJC-1295 and ipamorelin combination** offers the best balance of effectiveness, safety, and available evidence. It's the most commonly recommended starting point for anyone new to peptide protocols for muscle growth.

If you want oral dosing and don't mind the side effect trade-offs, **MK-677** is a strong alternative.

### Do peptides actually build muscle?

GH secretagogues raise growth hormone and IGF-1, both of which are directly involved in muscle protein synthesis and recovery. The effects are real but more gradual and subtle than anabolic steroids. Think of peptides as optimizers rather than shortcuts.

### How long before I see results from muscle-building peptides?

Most users report improved sleep and recovery within the first 1-2 weeks. Visible body composition changes typically take **8-12 weeks** of consistent use combined with progressive training and adequate protein intake.

### Can I take MK-677 with injectable peptides?

Yes, and many people do. MK-677 provides sustained baseline GH elevation while injectable GH secretagogues add pulsatile release on top. Watch for cumulative side effects like water retention and monitor blood glucose.

### Are muscle-building peptides legal?

Most are legal to purchase as "research chemicals" in the United States but are not FDA-approved for muscle building. Tesamorelin is the exception, holding FDA approval for HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Check our [peptide legality guide](/articles/are-peptides-legal-fda-regulations-2026) for current regulations.

### Do I need to cycle peptides?

GH secretagogues can desensitize receptors over time. Most protocols recommend **8-12 week cycles** followed by 4 weeks off, though some users run lower doses continuously. MK-677 is often run for longer periods, but insulin sensitivity should be monitored.

### What's the difference between GHRP-6 and ipamorelin?

Both stimulate GH release, but ipamorelin does so without significantly raising cortisol or prolactin. GHRP-6 produces stronger hunger stimulation and has a messier hormonal profile. Ipamorelin is the better choice for most people unless you specifically want the appetite boost of GHRP-6.

### Can women use these peptides for muscle growth?

Yes. GH secretagogues, BPC-157, and TB-500 are used by women at the same or slightly lower doses. IGF-1 LR3 and MK-677 carry the same considerations regardless of sex. Women may notice more pronounced effects on skin, hair, and sleep quality from GH elevation.

### Do I need to inject peptides on an empty stomach?

For GH secretagogues, yes. Insulin and elevated blood sugar blunt the GH response. Dose at least **2 hours after eating** and wait **30 minutes before eating** after injection. BPC-157 and TB-500 don't have this restriction.

---

## The Bottom Line

Peptides for muscle growth work best as part of a larger system. Training, nutrition, and sleep do the heavy lifting. Peptides optimize the hormonal environment to get more out of that work.

For most people, the **CJC-1295 and ipamorelin stack** is the right starting point. It's well-tolerated, well-studied relative to other options, and produces meaningful improvements in recovery, sleep, and body composition over 2-3 months.

If you want to go further, adding **MK-677** for sustained IGF-1 elevation or **BPC-157/TB-500** for recovery support are logical next steps. Save IGF-1 LR3 and follistatin for experienced users who understand the risk trade-offs.

The best peptide protocol is one you can sustain consistently alongside serious training. Start conservative, track your results, and adjust from there.
