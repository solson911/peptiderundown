# Retatrutide: The Triple-Action GLP-1 That's Changing Weight Loss

You already know about semaglutide and tirzepatide. They were big.

Retatrutide might be bigger.

It's the first **triple agonist** to hit clinical trials, targeting not two but **three metabolic receptors** at once. The early data? Stunning.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **First triple agonist** targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors simultaneously
> - **24.2% average weight loss** at the highest dose (12 mg) in just 48 weeks
> - **82% liver fat reduction** from the glucagon component
> - **Outperformed** semaglutide (~16%) and tirzepatide (~22%) in cross-trial comparisons
> - **Not yet FDA-approved**  -  phase 3 TRIUMPH trials are underway
> - **Estimated approval:** 2027-2028

## What Is Retatrutide?

Retatrutide (also known as **LY3437943**) is an investigational peptide developed by **Eli Lilly**.

It belongs to a new class called **triple hormone receptor agonists**, or "triagonists."

Here's how it compares to what's already out there:

| Drug | Targets | Generation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Semaglutide** (Ozempic/Wegovy) | GLP-1 only | 1st gen |
| **Tirzepatide** (Mounjaro/Zepbound) | GLP-1 + GIP | 2nd gen |
| **Retatrutide** | GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon | 3rd gen |

That third target  -  **glucagon**  -  is what sets retatrutide apart from everything else in the pipeline.

## How Retatrutide Works: Three Receptors, One Injection

Each receptor does something different. Together, they attack weight loss from every angle.

### GLP-1 Receptor: The Appetite Killer

GLP-1 is the foundation. When you eat, your gut releases it, and it triggers a cascade:

- **Stimulates insulin release**  -  improving blood sugar control
- **Slows gastric emptying**  -  food stays in your stomach longer
- **Signals the brain**  -  reducing hunger at a neurological level
- **Increases satiety**  -  you feel full faster and stay full longer

This is the same mechanism behind Ozempic and Wegovy. Read our full [semaglutide guide](/articles/semaglutide-weight-loss-guide) for details.

### GIP Receptor: The Amplifier

GIP is the second piece. For years, researchers debated whether GIP agonism helped or hurt weight loss.

Tirzepatide settled that debate. GIP activation:

- **Enhances GLP-1's effects**  -  making appetite suppression stronger
- **Improves insulin sensitivity**  -  better metabolic function overall
- **Regulates energy balance**  -  via signaling in the brain
- **May reduce fat accumulation**  -  in adipose tissue

([Samms et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866435/))

### Glucagon Receptor: The breakthrough

This is where retatrutide gets truly interesting.

Glucagon is traditionally the "opposite of insulin." But it does something critical for weight loss: **it increases energy expenditure**.

- **Ramps up thermogenesis**  -  your body generates more heat, burning calories
- **Promotes fat oxidation**  -  preferentially burns stored fat
- **Reduces liver fat**  -  directly targets hepatic fat metabolism
- **Fights fatty liver disease**  -  a condition affecting ~25% of the global population

> **Why This Matters:** None of the current GLP-1 drugs directly target liver fat. Glucagon does. That's a first.

### The Combined Effect

Put all three together:

| Mechanism | Driven By |
|-----------|-----------|
| Appetite suppression | GLP-1 + GIP |
| Blood sugar control | GLP-1 + GIP |
| Slower digestion | GLP-1 |
| Increased calorie burn | Glucagon |
| Fat oxidation | Glucagon |
| Liver fat reduction | Glucagon |

> **Bottom line:** You eat less, absorb differently, AND burn more. That's the triple agonist advantage.

## Clinical Trial Results: The Numbers

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept

Published in 2022. Small dose-ranging study in people with type 2 diabetes.

The highest doses produced significant weight loss over 12 weeks. Promising enough to fast-track into larger trials.

### Phase 2: The Breakthrough

Published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* ([Jastreboff et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37351564/)).

**Study design:**
- **338 adults** with obesity (BMI ≥30, or ≥27 with comorbidity)
- **48 weeks**, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Participants did **not** have diabetes

**Results by dose:**

| Dose (weekly) | Weight Loss | ~Pounds Lost (at 240 lb) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **1 mg** | 8.7% | ~21 lb |
| **4 mg** | 17.1-17.5% | ~41-42 lb |
| **8 mg** | 22.8% | ~55 lb |
| **12 mg** | **24.2%** | **~58 lb** |
| Placebo | 2.1% | ~5 lb |

Read that 12 mg number again. **24.2% body weight loss in 48 weeks.**

And the curves hadn't plateaued yet, suggesting even greater results with longer treatment.

> **For comparison:**
> - **Semaglutide** (Wegovy)  -  ~15-16% in the STEP trials
> - **Tirzepatide** (Zepbound)  -  ~20-22% in SURMOUNT-1
> - **Retatrutide**  -  **24.2%** and still climbing

### Diabetes Results

A parallel trial in people with **type 2 diabetes** ([Rosenstock et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37351563/)):

- **16.9% weight loss** at 36 weeks on the 12 mg dose
- Significant **HbA1c improvements**
- Many participants hit HbA1c below **5.7%**  -  technically non-diabetic range

### Liver Fat: The Standout Finding

> **Key Finding:** Retatrutide produced an **82% reduction in liver fat**  -  the most dramatic result in the entire trial.

Using MRI to measure hepatic fat:

- **82% relative reduction** in liver fat at 48 weeks (12 mg dose)
- **80%+ of patients** with fatty liver at baseline no longer qualified for MASLD diagnosis
- **No approved drugs** currently exist specifically for MASLD

This alone could be a reason for FDA interest, independent of the weight loss data.

## Dosing Protocol

Retatrutide is a **once-weekly subcutaneous injection** with a slow dose escalation to minimize GI side effects.

**Typical escalation from the phase 2 obesity trial:**

| Phase | Duration | Dose |
|-------|----------|------|
| Start | Weeks 1-4 | Low starting dose |
| Escalation | Every 4 weeks | Gradual increases |
| Maintenance | Ongoing | 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg |

> **Sweet spot:** The **8 mg dose** offered the best balance  -  **22.8% weight loss** with fewer side effects than 12 mg.

**Important:** These are clinical trial protocols. Retatrutide is **not yet approved**, so no official prescribing guidelines exist.

## Side Effects

Similar to other GLP-1 drugs. Gastrointestinal issues dominate, especially during dose escalation.

### Common (from phase 2 data)

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Nausea** | 25-45% | Worst during escalation, improves over time |
| **Diarrhea** | 20-35% | More common at higher doses |
| **Vomiting** | 10-20% | Usually temporary |
| **Constipation** | Less common | Lower rate than semaglutide |
| **Decreased appetite** | Common | Technically a therapeutic effect |

### Less Common

- **Injection site reactions**  -  mild redness or itching
- **Slight heart rate increase**  -  2-4 bpm, consistent with other GLP-1 drugs
- **Elevated lipase/amylase**  -  pancreatic enzymes; generally not clinically significant

### Dropout Rate

**6-10%** of participants in higher-dose groups quit due to side effects (mostly GI). Roughly comparable to tirzepatide.

### What About Blood Sugar Spikes?

A valid concern  -  glucagon's primary job is *raising* blood sugar.

In practice? **Not an issue.** The GLP-1 and GIP components counterbalance the glucagon effect. Blood sugar actually **improved** across all dose groups, even in non-diabetic participants.

## Retatrutide vs. Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide

The question everyone's asking.

| Feature | Semaglutide (Wegovy) | Tirzepatide (Zepbound) | Retatrutide |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Targets** | GLP-1 | GLP-1 + GIP | GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon |
| **Max weight loss** | ~16% | ~22% | ~24% |
| **Liver fat reduction** | Modest | Moderate | **Substantial (82%)** |
| **Dosing** | Weekly injection | Weekly injection | Weekly injection |
| **FDA approved** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Not yet |
| **Real-world data** | Years | Growing | Phase 2 only |
| **GI side effects** | Common | Common | Common |

> **Important:** These numbers come from different trials with different patient populations. Direct head-to-head data doesn't exist yet. But the trend is clear: **more targets = more weight loss.**

## Why the Glucagon Receptor Changes Everything

With GLP-1 alone, weight loss is mainly about **eating less**. That works, but it has a ceiling.

Here's the problem:

- You lose weight
- Your metabolic rate drops (adaptive thermogenesis)
- Reduced intake meets reduced burn
- **Weight loss stalls**

Glucagon breaks this cycle by working on the **"calories out" side:**

- **Increases resting energy expenditure** by an estimated 10-15% ([Habegger et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185758/))
- **Promotes fat oxidation**  -  your body burns stored fat preferentially
- **Reduces new fat creation** in the liver (de novo lipogenesis)

The result? Less metabolic slowdown. Less plateauing. More sustained weight loss.

> **Think of it this way:** GLP-1 drugs put your foot on the brake (less food in). Glucagon puts your foot on the gas (more energy out). Retatrutide does both.

## Can You Get Retatrutide Today?

**Short answer: not through normal channels.**

As of early 2026, retatrutide is **not approved** by the FDA or any other regulatory agency.

### Phase 3 Trials (TRIUMPH Program)

Eli Lilly launched four major trials in 2023-2024:

| Trial | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **TRIUMPH-1** | Obesity without diabetes | Underway |
| **TRIUMPH-2** | Obesity with type 2 diabetes | Underway |
| **TRIUMPH-3** | MASLD / fatty liver disease | Underway |
| **TRIUMPH-4** | Cardiovascular outcomes | Underway |

Results expected through 2025-2026.

### Gray Market Sources

Some research chemical suppliers offer "research" versions. **We don't recommend this.** Risks include:

- **Contamination**  -  no quality control
- **Incorrect dosing**  -  potentially dangerous
- **Degradation**  -  unknown storage conditions
- **Legal consequences**  -  varies by jurisdiction

### Expected Timeline

| Milestone | Estimated Date |
|-----------|---------------|
| Phase 3 results | 2025-2026 |
| FDA submission | Late 2026 - 2027 |
| **Potential approval** | **2027-2028** |

Eli Lilly has manufacturing infrastructure from tirzepatide, which should help speed the rollout.

## Who Might Benefit Most?

Based on the data so far, retatrutide could be ideal for:

- **People with BMI 35+**  -  who need more aggressive weight loss than current options
- **People with fatty liver disease**  -  given the 82% liver fat reduction
- **People with type 2 diabetes + obesity**  -  dual benefit of weight loss and glucose control
- **People who've plateaued on semaglutide or tirzepatide**  -  the glucagon component adds a new mechanism

> **Note:** This is speculative until phase 3 data confirms the findings and the drug is approved.

## Open Questions and Risks

No drug is perfect. Here's what we don't know yet:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **Long-term safety** | Only 48 weeks of data; chronic glucagon effects are unknown |
| **Muscle loss** | Glucagon may promote protein breakdown; phase 3 body composition data pending |
| **Cancer risk** | Same theoretical thyroid C-cell concern as all GLP-1 drugs (no human signal so far) |
| **Rebound weight** | Likely requires lifelong treatment, like all obesity drugs ([Wilding et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/)) |
| **Cost** | Expect $1,000+/month, similar to tirzepatide; insurance coverage is inconsistent |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much weight can you lose on retatrutide?

The highest dose (12 mg weekly) produced **24.2% average weight loss** over 48 weeks. Some participants lost over **30%**. The 8 mg dose hit **22.8%** with fewer side effects.

### Is retatrutide better than Ozempic?

By weight loss numbers, yes  -  significantly more. But "better" is complicated.

Semaglutide has:
- Years of real-world safety data
- Full FDA approval
- Proven cardiovascular benefits

Retatrutide has impressive phase 2 results. That's promising, not proven.

### When will retatrutide be available?

Assuming positive phase 3 results, **FDA approval could come in 2027-2028**. This estimate could shift.

### Is retatrutide safe?

Phase 2 shows a side effect profile similar to other GLP-1 drugs. No major safety signals. But we need longer-term phase 3 data, especially on the glucagon component.

### Can you take retatrutide with other medications?

Not extensively studied yet. The slowed gastric emptying could affect absorption of oral medications. Prescribers will need to evaluate interactions case-by-case.

### Will retatrutide be a pill or injection?

Currently a **once-weekly subcutaneous injection**. No oral formulation announced, though Eli Lilly is developing oral versions of other peptide drugs.

### Does retatrutide cause muscle loss?

All significant weight loss involves some lean mass loss. The ratio with retatrutide isn't fully characterized yet.

**Best practices during any weight loss protocol:**
- Resistance training (3-4x/week)
- High protein intake (0.7-1g per pound of body weight)
- Adequate sleep

### How is retatrutide different from tirzepatide?

One word: **glucagon**.

- Tirzepatide = GLP-1 + GIP (appetite + insulin)
- Retatrutide = GLP-1 + GIP + **Glucagon** (appetite + insulin + **energy burn**)

The glucagon component increases calorie expenditure and dramatically reduces liver fat, which tirzepatide does to a lesser extent.

## The Bottom Line

Retatrutide is the most promising obesity drug in development right now.

The triple agonist approach  -  appetite suppression, insulin improvement, AND increased energy burn  -  produced **24.2% weight loss** in phase 2. The **82% liver fat reduction** is unprecedented.

But it's early. Phase 2 involved a few hundred people over 48 weeks. Phase 3 will tell us if these results hold in thousands of patients over longer timeframes.

If they do, retatrutide could become the **most effective obesity treatment ever approved**.

That's a big "if." But it's one worth watching.
