# How to Store Peptides: Lyophilized and Reconstituted

Peptides aren't cheap. Nothing's more frustrating than pulling a vial out of the fridge only to realize it's gone cloudy, lost potency, or degraded because of a storage mistake you could have easily avoided.

Proper storage is straightforward once you understand the basics.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **Lyophilized (powder):** Store frozen (-20C) for years of stability; fridge is OK for months
> - **Reconstituted with BAC water:** Fridge only, use within 3-4 weeks
> - **Reconstituted with sterile water:** Fridge only, use within 48-72 hours
> - **Never freeze reconstituted peptides**  -  ice crystals destroy peptide chains
> - **Always store in the dark**  -  UV triggers photodegradation

## Storage Quick Reference

| State | Temperature | Light | Shelf Life |
|-------|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Lyophilized (powder)** | Freezer (-20C) ideal; fridge OK | Dark | 2-3 years frozen |
| **Reconstituted (BAC water)** | Fridge (2-8C) only | Dark | 3-4 weeks |
| **Reconstituted (sterile water)** | Fridge (2-8C) only | Dark | 48-72 hours |

## Lyophilized vs. Reconstituted

**Lyophilized peptides** are freeze-dried powders. In this state, peptides are remarkably stable. The freeze-drying process removes virtually all water, and without water, most degradation pathways can't proceed.

**Reconstituted peptides** have been mixed with a solvent (usually bacteriostatic water or sterile water). Once you add liquid, you've restarted the clock on degradation.

> **Key Rule:** Never freeze reconstituted peptides. Never leave reconstituted peptides at room temperature. Fridge only.

Think of it like coffee. Whole beans last months in your pantry. Once you brew a pot, you've got hours before it goes stale. Peptides work on a longer timeline, but the principle is identical.

## Storing Lyophilized Peptides

### Temperature Guidelines

| Storage Condition | Stability | Best For |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **-20C (freezer)** | Years (2-3+) | Long-term storage |
| **2-8C (fridge)** | 6-12 months | Medium-term storage |
| **Room temperature** | Weeks to months | Avoid for extended periods |

Research in the *Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences* shows lyophilized peptides stored at -20C retain structural integrity and bioactivity for years ([PubMed: 25200029](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25200029/)).

For compound-specific stability data, [peptidearc.com](https://peptidearc.com) provides storage recommendations.

### Light Sensitivity

Most peptides are sensitive to UV light, which triggers photodegradation through oxidation of amino acid residues like tryptophan and tyrosine ([PubMed: 26055427](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26055427/)).

- **Keep vials in original box** or wrap in aluminum foil
- **Store in dark area** of freezer or fridge
- **Minimize counter time**  -  grab the vial, use it, put it back

### Moisture Protection

Moisture is the silent killer of lyophilized peptides. The entire point of freeze-drying is to remove water.

- **Keep vials sealed** until ready to reconstitute
- **Store desiccant packets** alongside vials
- **Don't open to check**  -  unnecessary exposure
- **Humid climates**  -  double-bag with desiccant before freezing

### Shelf Life by Sensitivity

| Peptide Type | Shelf Life (-20C, sealed) |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Most peptides** | 2-3 years, sometimes longer |
| **Sensitive compounds** (methionine-containing) | 1-2 years |
| **Compromised seal or moisture** | Unpredictable  -  use soon or discard |

## Storing Reconstituted Peptides

### Solvent Comparison

| Factor | Bacteriostatic Water | Sterile Water |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Preservative** | 0.9% benzyl alcohol | None |
| **Multi-dose use** | Yes (antimicrobial protection) | Risky |
| **Shelf life (refrigerated)** | 3-4 weeks | 48-72 hours |
| **Contamination risk** | Lower | Higher with each puncture |

A 2012 study found that preservative-free formulations showed significantly higher contamination after repeated access ([PubMed: 22610028](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22610028/)).

> **Bottom Line:** Use bacteriostatic water unless you have a specific reason not to.

### Handling Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Swab vial stopper** with alcohol pad before each use | Prevents contamination |
| **Roll gently, don't shake** | Aggressive agitation denatures peptides |
| **Minimize time outside fridge** | Every minute at room temp is unnecessary degradation |
| **Use consistent needle gauge** | Minimizes stopper coring |
| **Label with date and concentration** | No guessing about age |

### Reconstituted Shelf Life

| Solvent | Refrigerated Shelf Life |
|---------|------------------------|
| **BAC water  -  most peptides** | 3-4 weeks |
| **BAC water  -  delicate compounds** | ~2 weeks |
| **Sterile water  -  all peptides** | 48-72 hours (1 week max) |
| **Any visual changes** | Discard immediately |

## Signs of Peptide Degradation

### Visual Warning Signs

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|-------------|
| **Cloudiness or haziness** | Protein aggregation or contamination |
| **Visible particles or floaters** | Degradation products or microbial growth |
| **Color changes** | Oxidative degradation (should be clear/colorless) |
| **Film inside vial** | Denatured protein coating |
| **Collapsed/wet lyophilized cake** | Moisture exposure |
| **Yellow or brown discoloration** | Advanced degradation |

### Functional Signs

- **Reduced effects** at your usual dose
- **Increased injection site reactions** compared to fresh product

> **Important:** Degraded peptides aren't just ineffective. They can potentially contain harmful breakdown products. When in doubt, discard and start fresh.

## Traveling with Peptides

### Short Trips (1-3 Days)

- **Insulated cooler bag** with ice pack (lunch box style works)
- **Carry-on for flights**  -  never checked luggage (cargo hold can freeze)
- **Prescription or doctor's letter** speeds TSA interactions

### Longer Trips

- **Hotel mini-fridge** works in a pinch (temperatures can be inconsistent)
- **Bring lyophilized vials instead**  -  no cold-chain worries during transit
- **Reconstitute at destination** with separately packed BAC water
- **Digital thermometer** for cooler monitoring (under $10)

## Common Storage Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Freezing reconstituted peptides** | Ice crystals break peptide bonds | Freezer for powder only |
| **Leaving vials on counter** | Unnecessary degradation | Prep first, then grab vial |
| **Storing in fridge door** | Warmest spot, most temperature fluctuation | Back of a shelf |
| **Not labeling vials** | Can't track age or concentration | Write date + concentration on vial |
| **Expired BAC water** | Reduced preservative effectiveness | Check expiration dates |
| **Storing near strong-smelling food** | Rubber stoppers absorb odors | Dedicated container |

## Refrigerator Setup Tips

| Tip | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| **Use a dedicated small container** | Organization, light protection |
| **Store vials upright** | Minimizes stopper contact, keeps solution pooled |
| **Check fridge temperature** | Should be 1-5C; cheap thermometer is a smart investment |
| **Keep away from back wall** | Cold spots can drop below freezing |
| **Avoid vegetable crisper** | Higher humidity settings |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I freeze reconstituted peptides to make them last longer?

No. Freezing causes ice crystal formation that physically damages peptide chains. Only freeze lyophilized powder.

### How long do lyophilized peptides last at room temperature?

Most tolerate room temperature for weeks to a few months without significant degradation. If accidentally left out for a day or two, it's almost certainly fine. Make long-term storage cold.

### Does the type of peptide affect storage requirements?

Yes. Peptides containing oxidation-sensitive residues (methionine, cysteine, tryptophan) are less stable and benefit most from cold, dark storage. Check [peptidearc.com](https://peptidearc.com) for compound-specific guidance.

### Can I reconstitute, use some, then freeze the rest?

Not recommended. Home freezers cool too slowly, causing damaging ice crystal formation. Reconstitute only what you'll use within 3-4 weeks.

### My peptide solution looks slightly yellow. Is it still good?

Probably not. Most solutions should be clear and colorless. Yellow tint indicates oxidative degradation. When in doubt, discard.

### What's the difference between bacteriostatic water and sterile water?

BAC water contains **0.9% benzyl alcohol** as a preservative, allowing multi-dose use over weeks. Sterile water has no additives and should be used for single-dose applications or consumed quickly.

### I lost power and my fridge was off for six hours. Are my peptides ruined?

Most likely not. A closed refrigerator maintains safe temperatures for about **four hours**. If the fridge stayed closed for less than six hours, your peptides should be fine.

### Should I use a dedicated mini-fridge?

Not necessary, but convenient. Main advantage is consistent temperature without constant door-opening. A standard refrigerator works well following the guidelines above.
