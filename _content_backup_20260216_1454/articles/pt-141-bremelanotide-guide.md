# PT-141 (Bremelanotide): The Peptide That Treats Sexual Dysfunction Through Your Brain

Viagra and Cialis work on blood flow. PT-141 works on your brain.

That distinction matters more than you might think. Most sexual dysfunction treatments target plumbing. PT-141 targets desire itself, activating melanocortin receptors in the central nervous system to increase arousal at its source.

It's also one of the few peptides with actual FDA approval behind it.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **FDA-approved in 2019** as Vyleesi for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women
> - **Works through the brain** by activating melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R), not through blood flow
> - **Effective in both men and women** in clinical research, though only approved for women
> - **Subcutaneous injection** given at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity
> - **Not a daily medication** and should not be used more than once every 24 hours
> - **Most common side effect** is nausea, which affects roughly 40% of users

## What Is PT-141?

PT-141, known by its generic name **bremelanotide**, is a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide derived from **Melanotan II**. It was developed by Palatin Technologies and is marketed under the brand name **Vyleesi**.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Generic Name** | Bremelanotide |
| **Brand Name** | Vyleesi |
| **Type** | Synthetic cyclic heptapeptide |
| **Molecular Formula** | C50H68N14O10 |
| **Molecular Weight** | 1,025.2 Da |
| **Origin** | Derived from alpha-MSH / Melanotan II |
| **FDA Approval** | June 2019 (HSDD in premenopausal women) |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection (autoinjector) |

Unlike its parent compound Melanotan II, PT-141 was specifically engineered to isolate the pro-sexual effects while reducing melanogenic (skin-darkening) activity.

## How PT-141 Works

Every other sexual dysfunction drug on the market works downstream, targeting blood vessels or hormones. PT-141 goes upstream.

### Melanocortin Receptor Activation

PT-141 is a **melanocortin receptor agonist**. It binds primarily to **MC4R** and to a lesser degree **MC3R** in the hypothalamus and limbic system.

These receptors sit at the center of the brain's sexual arousal circuitry.

When PT-141 activates MC4R:

- **Increases dopamine release** in the medial preoptic area, a region critical to sexual motivation
- **Activates hypothalamic pathways** that govern sexual arousal and desire
- **Modulates oxytocin signaling** which plays a role in bonding and sexual response
- **Bypasses the vascular system entirely** unlike PDE5 inhibitors

([Pfaus et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15474589/))

### Why the Brain Matters

Sexual response has two distinct components: **desire** (wanting) and **arousal** (physical readiness).

PDE5 inhibitors like Viagra address arousal. They increase blood flow to erectile tissue. But if the desire isn't there, blood flow alone won't fix the problem.

PT-141 targets desire. That's why it works in populations where Viagra fails, particularly women with HSDD and men whose erectile dysfunction has a psychological or motivational component.

> **Key Finding:** In animal models, PT-141 induced erections in male rats and lordosis behavior in female rats through central nervous system pathways, independent of peripheral blood flow changes ([Martin et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12459206/)).

### The Melanocortin System

The melanocortin system regulates far more than skin pigmentation. MC4R specifically is involved in:

- **Sexual function and arousal**
- **Energy homeostasis and appetite**
- **Cardiovascular regulation**
- **Pain modulation**

This is why PT-141 can cause side effects like nausea and blood pressure changes. It's activating a system with broad physiological reach.

## FDA Approval: Vyleesi

On **June 21, 2019**, the FDA approved bremelanotide (Vyleesi) for the treatment of **hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)** in premenopausal women. It was only the second drug ever approved for this indication, following flibanserin (Addyi) in 2015.

| Approval Detail | Information |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Date** | June 21, 2019 |
| **Indication** | HSDD in premenopausal women |
| **Manufacturer** | AMAG Pharmaceuticals (licensed from Palatin Technologies) |
| **Delivery** | Single-dose autoinjector (1.75 mg) |
| **Dosing** | As needed, at least 45 min before activity |
| **Max frequency** | Once per 24 hours, max 8 doses per month |

The approval was based on two pivotal Phase 3 trials: **RECONNECT-1** and **RECONNECT-2**.

> **Important:** Vyleesi is not approved for men, postmenopausal women, or erectile dysfunction. Off-label use exists, but clinical data in men is more limited.

## Clinical Evidence

### RECONNECT Trials (Women with HSDD)

The two Phase 3 RECONNECT trials enrolled over **1,200 premenopausal women** diagnosed with HSDD.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Participants** | 1,247 premenopausal women with HSDD |
| **Duration** | 24 weeks |
| **Design** | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled |
| **Dose** | 1.75 mg subcutaneous, as needed |
| **Primary Endpoints** | Change in desire (FSFI-D) and distress (FSDS-DAO) scores |

**Results:**

| Outcome | Bremelanotide | Placebo |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Desire score improvement (FSFI-D)** | +0.57 | +0.21 |
| **Distress score improvement (FSDS-DAO)** | -0.72 | -0.41 |
| **Satisfying sexual events (increase)** | +0.7 per month | +0.4 per month |
| **Responder rate (desire)** | ~35% | ~22% |

([Kingsberg et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31416681/))

The effect sizes were modest but statistically significant. Critics noted the clinical relevance of these improvements is debatable. Supporters pointed out that HSDD is notoriously difficult to treat and any measurable improvement in desire is meaningful.

### Male Erectile Dysfunction Studies

PT-141 has been studied in men with erectile dysfunction in earlier-phase trials with encouraging results.

A Phase 2 trial in men with ED who had **failed to respond to sildenafil** showed that PT-141 produced erections sufficient for intercourse in a significant percentage of participants.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Participants** | 342 men with ED |
| **Design** | Randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging |
| **Dose range** | 0.3 mg to 10 mg (intranasal) |
| **Key finding** | Significant erectile response at doses of 4 mg and above |

([Diamond et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16422843/))

> **Key Finding:** In men who failed Viagra, PT-141 still produced measurable improvements in erectile function, supporting its unique central mechanism of action.

A separate study by Rosen et al. evaluated subcutaneous bremelanotide in men with ED and found dose-dependent increases in erectile function, including in men with diabetes-related ED.

([Rosen et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15474588/))

### Psychogenic Erectile Dysfunction

PT-141 may be particularly useful for **psychogenic ED**, where the problem originates in the brain rather than the vasculature.

Since PT-141 works centrally, it addresses the psychological and motivational components that PDE5 inhibitors cannot. No large-scale trials have been completed for this specific indication, but the mechanism strongly supports its potential.

## Dosing

> **Important:** These are based on FDA-approved labeling and clinical research protocols. Always work with a qualified provider.

### FDA-Approved Dosing (Vyleesi)

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Dose** | 1.75 mg |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection (abdomen or thigh) |
| **Timing** | At least 45 minutes before anticipated activity |
| **Maximum frequency** | Once per 24 hours |
| **Monthly limit** | 8 doses per month |
| **Onset** | 45 minutes to 2 hours |
| **Duration of effect** | Up to 12 hours (varies by individual) |

### Research Dosing (Off-Label / Men)

Dosing in male studies has varied. The following reflects protocols from clinical trials:

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Dose range studied** | 0.5 mg to 2 mg (subcutaneous) |
| **Common research dose** | 1 mg to 2 mg |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Timing** | 30 to 60 minutes before activity |

> **Important:** Higher doses do not necessarily produce better results but do increase the likelihood of nausea and blood pressure elevation. More is not better with this peptide.

### Reconstitution

If using lyophilized powder (research setting), follow standard peptide reconstitution with bacteriostatic water. See our [reconstitution guide](/articles/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) for step-by-step instructions.

## Side Effects

The side effect profile is well-characterized from the RECONNECT trials and other clinical studies. Nausea is by far the most common complaint.

### Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Nausea** | ~40% | Most common; usually mild to moderate, resolves within hours |
| **Flushing** | ~20% | Facial and upper body warmth and redness |
| **Headache** | ~11% | Typically mild |
| **Injection site reactions** | ~5-6% | Bruising, redness, itching at injection site |
| **Transient blood pressure increase** | Common | Typically 2-6 mmHg systolic; resolves within 12 hours |

### Less Common

- **Fatigue** following use
- **Dizziness** in a small percentage of users
- **Hyperpigmentation** with repeated use (darkening of skin, gums, or breasts)
- **Nasal congestion** reported in intranasal formulation studies

### When to Stop

- **Persistent blood pressure elevation** seek medical attention, especially if you have uncontrolled hypertension
- **Severe nausea or vomiting** that doesn't resolve within a few hours
- **Darkening of skin or gums** indicating melanocyte stimulation; discuss with your provider

> **Important:** PT-141 is contraindicated in patients with **uncontrolled hypertension** or **cardiovascular disease** due to its transient blood pressure effects. It should not be used alongside flibanserin (Addyi).

## PT-141 vs. Viagra vs. Cialis

This is the comparison most people want. The three drugs could not be more different in how they work.

| Feature | PT-141 (Bremelanotide) | Viagra (Sildenafil) | Cialis (Tadalafil) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Melanocortin receptor agonist (brain) | PDE5 inhibitor (blood vessels) | PDE5 inhibitor (blood vessels) |
| **Primary target** | Sexual desire and arousal | Erectile blood flow | Erectile blood flow |
| **Works in women** | Yes (FDA-approved for HSDD) | Generally no | Generally no |
| **Works in men** | Yes (off-label, studied) | Yes (FDA-approved) | Yes (FDA-approved) |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection | Oral tablet | Oral tablet |
| **Onset** | 45 min to 2 hours | 30 to 60 minutes | 30 to 60 minutes |
| **Duration** | Up to 12 hours | 4 to 6 hours | Up to 36 hours |
| **Addresses desire** | Yes | No | No |
| **Common side effects** | Nausea, flushing | Headache, flushing, visual changes | Headache, back pain, flushing |
| **Blood pressure effect** | Slight increase | Decrease | Decrease |

### When PT-141 Might Be the Better Choice

- **Low desire is the primary issue**, not physical erectile difficulty
- **PDE5 inhibitors haven't worked** or caused intolerable side effects
- **Female sexual dysfunction**, where Viagra and Cialis have no role
- **Psychological or motivational ED** where the brain is the bottleneck
- **Combined with PDE5 inhibitors** for men who want both desire enhancement and blood flow support (under medical supervision)

### When PDE5 Inhibitors Are Better

- **Vascular ED** with clear blood flow limitation
- **Preference for oral dosing** over injections
- **Well-established safety profile** with decades of real-world data
- **Cost and accessibility** since generics are widely available

> **Bottom line:** PT-141 and PDE5 inhibitors solve different problems. One addresses want. The other addresses can. Some people need both.

## PT-141 vs. Flibanserin (Addyi)

Since both are FDA-approved for HSDD in premenopausal women, this comparison comes up frequently.

| Feature | PT-141 (Vyleesi) | Flibanserin (Addyi) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Dosing** | As needed (injection) | Daily (oral pill, 100 mg at bedtime) |
| **Onset** | 45 minutes to 2 hours | 4 to 8 weeks of daily use |
| **Mechanism** | MC4R agonist | 5-HT1A agonist / 5-HT2A antagonist |
| **Alcohol restriction** | None | Severe (risk of hypotension and syncope) |
| **Common side effects** | Nausea, flushing | Dizziness, sleepiness, nausea |
| **REMS program** | No | Yes (due to alcohol interaction) |
| **Convenience** | As-needed, no daily commitment | Must take every night for weeks |

PT-141 has a clear advantage for women who don't want a daily medication or who drink alcohol. Flibanserin's alcohol restriction and mandatory REMS certification for prescribers have significantly limited its adoption.

## Who Might Benefit

Based on clinical data and the mechanism of action:

- **Premenopausal women with HSDD** the only FDA-approved indication
- **Men with ED who haven't responded to PDE5 inhibitors** supported by Phase 2 data
- **Men with psychogenic ED** where desire or arousal initiation is the core issue
- **Couples where desire discrepancy is the problem** rather than physical function

> **Important:** PT-141 is not recommended for individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or those taking flibanserin. It should not be used in pregnancy. Always consult a healthcare provider.

## Legal Status and Availability

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **United States** | FDA-approved as Vyleesi (prescription only); also available as research peptide |
| **European Union** | Not approved; available through research chemical suppliers |
| **Australia** | Not TGA-approved; available through compounding pharmacies in some cases |
| **Canada** | Not approved by Health Canada |

The Vyleesi autoinjector is available by prescription in the U.S. It is typically not covered by insurance and costs approximately **$800 to $1,000** for a pack of four autoinjectors.

Research-grade PT-141 is available from peptide suppliers at significantly lower cost, though without the quality assurance of pharmaceutical manufacturing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does PT-141 actually feel like?

Most users describe a gradual increase in sexual desire and arousal starting about 45 minutes to 2 hours after injection. It's not an immediate or overwhelming effect. Some describe a "warmth" or heightened sensitivity to physical contact. Nausea is common in the first hour or two, particularly with the first few uses.

### How long does PT-141 last?

Effects typically persist for **6 to 12 hours**, though this varies. The peak effect is usually 2 to 4 hours after injection. Some users report residual effects into the following day.

### Can men use PT-141?

Yes, though it's not FDA-approved for men. Clinical trials have shown it produces measurable improvements in erectile function, particularly in men who didn't respond to Viagra. Many men's health clinics prescribe it off-label.

### Is PT-141 the same as Melanotan II?

No. PT-141 is a **metabolite derivative** of Melanotan II, but with key differences:

- **PT-141** is a cyclic heptapeptide (7 amino acids) that primarily targets MC4R
- **Melanotan II** is a larger peptide that activates multiple melanocortin receptors, causing significant skin tanning, appetite suppression, and sexual arousal
- **PT-141 causes less skin darkening** than Melanotan II, though some hyperpigmentation can still occur with repeated use

### Can you combine PT-141 with Viagra or Cialis?

Some providers do prescribe this combination. PT-141 addresses desire (brain) while PDE5 inhibitors address blood flow (peripheral). The combination can be effective for men with both motivational and vascular components to their ED.

However, monitor blood pressure carefully. PT-141 slightly raises blood pressure while PDE5 inhibitors lower it. The effects may partially offset, but individual responses vary.

### Does PT-141 work for everyone?

No. In the RECONNECT trials, about **35% of women** were classified as responders based on desire improvement. That means a majority did not see clinically meaningful benefit. Response rates in men appear higher in the available data, but larger trials are needed.

### Are there long-term risks?

Long-term safety data is limited. The main concerns are:

- **Hyperpigmentation** with chronic use, which may or may not be reversible
- **Blood pressure effects** in people with cardiovascular risk factors
- **Unknown effects** of chronic MC4R activation on appetite, weight, and metabolism

The FDA label recommends limiting use to **8 doses per month** partly due to these unknowns.

### Why is PT-141 an injection and not a pill?

PT-141 is a peptide, and peptides are generally broken down by digestive enzymes before they can be absorbed. Subcutaneous injection bypasses the GI tract and delivers the drug directly into the bloodstream. An intranasal formulation was studied earlier in development but was abandoned due to blood pressure concerns at the nasal doses required.

## The Bottom Line

PT-141 is genuinely different from everything else in the sexual dysfunction space. It's the only approved treatment that works through the brain's melanocortin system to increase desire rather than simply improving blood flow.

For women with HSDD, it offers an as-needed alternative to daily flibanserin without alcohol restrictions. For men, the off-label evidence suggests real utility, especially in cases where PDE5 inhibitors have failed or where the problem is motivational rather than vascular.

The trade-offs are real. Nausea affects a large percentage of users. It requires injection rather than a pill. And the effect sizes in clinical trials, while statistically significant, were modest. Not everyone responds.

But for the right patient, PT-141 fills a gap that no other drug currently addresses. It treats the wanting, not just the doing.
