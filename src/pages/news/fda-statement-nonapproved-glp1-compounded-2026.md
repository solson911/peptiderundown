The FDA just put more weight behind something peptide watchers have been tracking for months: the line between traditional compounding and mass-market manufacturing is getting a lot harder to ignore.

On February 6, 2026, FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary published a statement saying the agency intends to take “decisive steps” to restrict GLP-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients used in non-FDA-approved compounded drugs that are being mass-marketed as alternatives to approved products.

The statement also calls out direct-to-consumer advertising. The FDA says companies cannot market compounded GLP-1 products as “generic” versions, claim they are the same as FDA-approved drugs, or imply they use the same active ingredient as approved products.

## Why this is more than another warning

You have seen FDA letters and enforcement talk before. This one reads differently because it is explicit about the next step.

The agency says it will use “all available compliance and enforcement tools,” and that failure to address violations “may result in legal action without further notice,” including seizure and injunction.

That matters because GLP-1 demand created a parallel supply chain. Some of it is legitimate, patient-specific compounding. Some of it looks like scalable production plus marketing that borrows the credibility of branded drugs.

The FDA is signaling it intends to squeeze the active ingredient side of the market, not just police the ads.


## How we got here: shortage rules opened the door

Compounding is not the same as making generics.

Under U.S. law, certain compounding activities are allowed when there is a patient-specific need, or when a drug is in shortage and compounding helps fill a gap. During the semaglutide and tirzepatide shortage era, access problems pushed patients toward compounded versions.

Scientific American notes that tirzepatide was removed from the FDA shortage list in December 2024, and semaglutide was removed in February 2025. Yet many compounded GLP-1 products stayed on the market by tweaking formulations, sometimes adding ingredients like B vitamins or levocarnitine and marketing them as a feature.

Add-ons are not automatically unsafe, but they are often not supported by clinical trials. And the FDA does not review compounded products for safety, quality, or effectiveness the way it reviews approved drugs.


## The pressure cooker effect: lawsuits land right on top of FDA action

The FDA statement did something else that is unusual. It named names.

It specifically mentioned “Hims & Hers and other compounding pharmacies” as examples of mass-marketing behavior.

Within days, Novo Nordisk announced it filed a lawsuit accusing Hims & Hers of infringing a U.S. patent and unlawfully mass marketing compounded semaglutide products.

Novo Nordisk’s claim is blunt: it argues that mass-marketed compounded semaglutide can contain dangerous impurities or incorrect amounts of active ingredient. The company says its own testing found high impurity levels in some compounded products (Novo’s release cites values up to 86% for injectable compounded semaglutide samples).

To be clear, a company press release is not the same thing as an FDA lab report or a peer-reviewed paper. But it does show where this is headed. Manufacturers will keep using IP law and public-safety messaging to defend market share. The FDA will keep pushing on quality and labeling. And patients are stuck in the middle.


## What this means for patients and clinics right now

This is not a call to panic. It is a call to ask better questions.

If you are a patient:

- Ask whether your prescription is for an FDA-approved product or a compounded product.
- If compounded, ask what active ingredient source is used and what testing documentation exists (identity, potency, sterility for injectables).
- Be wary of marketing that promises brand-equivalent results without the brand-equivalent evidence.

If you are a clinician or clinic operator:

- Review your marketing language. The FDA is saying certain claims are out of bounds.
- Expect scrutiny around active ingredients and supply chains.
- Prepare for more enforcement activity, not less.


## The bigger peptide-market takeaway

GLP-1s have become the center of gravity for the whole peptide economy. When regulators move on GLP-1 compounding, it changes expectations for everything adjacent: sourcing standards, testing norms, and what “research use” is allowed to look like in public.

And that is the real signal in this week’s news.

The FDA is not just talking about a product class. It is trying to re-draw the boundary between personalized pharmacy practice and mass-market peptide distribution.
