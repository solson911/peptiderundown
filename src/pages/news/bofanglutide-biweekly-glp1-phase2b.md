The obesity drug race is starting to split into two lanes.

One lane chases bigger weight loss with more potent combos. The other chases convenience, because weekly injections still feel like a chore for a lot of people.

A new phase 2b trial published Feb 27, 2026 reports that **bofanglutide**, a GLP-1 receptor agonist designed for once-every-two-weeks dosing, produced substantial weight loss over 30 weeks in Chinese adults with overweight or obesity.

Source study (PubMed): https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41760612/


## Trial basics in plain language

The trial was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.

Participants were adults with:

- Overweight (BMI 24 to <28) plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, or
- Obesity (BMI ≥28)

A total of 340 participants were randomized.

The dosing arms were built around two concepts: multiple biweekly (Q2W) dose levels, and one weekly (QW) arm for comparison.

- 12 mg Q2W
- 18 mg Q2W
- 24 mg Q2W
- 48 mg Q2W
- 24 mg QW
- Placebo

The primary endpoint was percent change in body weight from baseline to week 30.


## The headline numbers

Mean weight change from baseline to week 30 ranged from:

- **-9.75% to -16.69%** with bofanglutide
- **-1.15%** with placebo

All active arms were statistically significant versus placebo (p < 0.001).

Completion rate was also solid for a 30-week obesity trial: 84.1% overall.


## Side effects: mostly GI, mostly mild

Adverse events were common, which is typical for GLP-1 class agents.

- Any adverse event: 98.9% with bofanglutide vs 86.4% with placebo
- GI events (mostly grade 1 to 2): 83.9% with bofanglutide vs 33.3% with placebo

That reads like a familiar GLP-1 tradeoff.

More weight loss tends to come with more GI friction. The question for a biweekly product is whether fewer injection days offsets that friction for enough patients to matter.


## Why “every two weeks” is a big deal

Weekly dosing sounds easy until you are the one living it.

People miss travel weeks. They forget after a schedule change. They delay because of a social event, then the routine breaks.

A truly biweekly GLP-1 could change adherence in the real world, even if the biology is similar. That might be especially true for patients who already take other weekly injections or have complex medication routines.

It is also a market signal.

If longer-interval GLP-1s perform well, it opens the door to broader innovation in peptide half-life engineering and depot-style delivery.


## Important caveats

A few details matter when you interpret this study.

- This was a single-country population. Global generalizability is not automatic.

- The trial runs 30 weeks. That is long enough to be meaningful, but it is not the same as multi-year maintenance data.

- Many authors reported ties to the sponsor (Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals), and several were employees or shareholders. That does not invalidate the data, but it should make readers extra attentive to follow-up studies and independent replication.

The authors also describe the trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06256562) and ethical oversight, which is helpful for transparency.


## What this means for the peptide world

GLP-1s sit at the intersection of peptide science and public attention.

They are also setting new expectations for what “effective” obesity therapy looks like. Double-digit average weight loss is no longer a shock headline. It is becoming a baseline competitor standard.

Bofanglutide’s story is not just about percent weight loss. It is about whether convenience can compete with raw potency.

If biweekly dosing holds up in later trials, it could become a real differentiator. And for patients who are on the fence, convenience is often the thing that decides whether a drug gets started at all.


## What to watch next

For bofanglutide, the next milestones are predictable.

- Dose selection for phase 3
- Longer-term maintenance and discontinuation data
- Comparative effectiveness versus established weekly GLP-1s

If the company can show similar outcomes with fewer missed doses and better persistence, that will be a meaningful contribution.

And if not, it still tells us something.

Convenience is powerful, but biology still wins.
