The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has intensified its crackdown on compounding pharmacies illegally selling semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredients in popular GLP-1 agonist medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro. This enforcement action comes as drug shortages for these medications have largely resolved, reducing the legal justification for compounding these drugs under FDA exemptions.

Compounding pharmacies had been allowed to produce versions of these drugs during the shortage, but many continued to do so even after supplies stabilized. The FDA has now issued warning letters to multiple pharmacies, emphasizing that compounded versions of these peptides are not FDA-approved and may pose safety risks due to inconsistent potency or purity.

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the manufacturers of semaglutide and tirzepatide respectively, have supported the FDA's actions. Both companies have filed lawsuits against compounding pharmacies they allege are infringing on their patents and misleading consumers about the safety and efficacy of compounded products.

Patient access remains a concern, as compounded versions were often more affordable than brand-name drugs. The FDA has acknowledged this issue but maintains that patient safety must come first. State regulations vary widely, with some states taking a harder line against compounding pharmacies than others.

For patients affected by these changes, consulting with a healthcare provider about alternative treatment options or patient assistance programs is recommended.
