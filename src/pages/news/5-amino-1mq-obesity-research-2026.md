A February 2026 study published in Cell Metabolism reveals promising results for 5-Amino-1MQ as a novel obesity treatment. The compound works by inhibiting nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), an enzyme linked to metabolic dysfunction.

Unlike popular GLP-1 agonists that primarily suppress appetite, 5-Amino-1MQ appears to enhance fat oxidation while preserving lean mass. Animal models showed significant reductions in visceral fat without the muscle loss associated with calorie restriction. The study also noted improved insulin sensitivity in treated subjects.

Researchers highlight 5-Amino-1MQ's oral bioavailability as a key advantage over injectable peptides. Early pharmacokinetic data suggests stable blood levels with twice-daily dosing. However, human trials are still needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

This research adds to growing interest in NNMT inhibition as a metabolic therapy approach. Unlike GLP-1 drugs that require continuous use, 5-Amino-1MQ may offer more durable effects after treatment cessation based on animal data.
