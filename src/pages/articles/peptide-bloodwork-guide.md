# Peptide Bloodwork Guide  -  Essential Labs Before and During Peptide Use

Peptides can be powerful tools for health and performance, but they also interact with your body in complex ways. Without proper monitoring, you might miss critical changes in your biomarkers. This guide covers the **essential bloodwork** you need before starting peptides and how to track your health during use.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **Baseline labs are non-negotiable**  -  establish your starting point before any peptide protocol.
> - **Different peptides require different panels**  -  GH secretagogues need IGF-1, <a href="/articles/semaglutide-weight-loss-guide">GLP-1s</a> need A1c, and healing peptides need inflammation markers.
> - **Timing matters**  -  some labs should be drawn fasted, others post-dose.
> - **Red flags exist**  -  certain results mean you should stop peptides immediately.
> - **Cost varies**  -  cash pay options like HealthLabs can be cheaper than insurance for some tests.

## Why Bloodwork Matters

Peptides influence hormones, metabolism, and organ function. Without labs, you’re flying blind. Bloodwork helps you:

- **Identify underlying issues**  -  like undiagnosed thyroid dysfunction or insulin resistance.
- **Monitor safety**  -  catch liver stress, kidney strain, or hormonal imbalances early.
- **Optimize dosing**  -  adjust based on IGF-1 levels, glucose, or other biomarkers.
- **Avoid long-term harm**  -  some changes are silent until they’re severe.

> **Bottom line:** Skipping labs is like driving without a dashboard. You might get where you’re going, but you won’t know if something’s wrong until it’s too late.

## Baseline Labs: What to Test Before Starting

These tests establish your starting point. Get them **1-2 weeks before** beginning any peptide protocol.

### thorough Metabolic Panel (CMP)

Measures liver, kidney, and electrolyte function. Critical for peptides metabolized by the liver (e.g., GLP-1s).

| Test | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **ALT/AST** | Liver enzymes  -  elevated levels indicate stress or damage. |
| **Albumin** | Protein levels  -  low albumin can signal malnutrition or kidney issues. |
| **Creatinine** | Kidney function  -  high levels may indicate impaired filtration. |
| **Glucose** | Blood sugar  -  baseline for monitoring GLP-1 or GH secretagogues. |

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)

Checks for anemia, infection, or immune system issues.

| Test | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **Hemoglobin** | Oxygen transport  -  low levels suggest anemia. |
| **White blood cells** | Immune function  -  abnormal counts can indicate infection or inflammation. |
| **Platelets** | Clotting ability  -  low platelets increase bleeding risk. |

### Hormone Panels

Baseline hormones help interpret changes caused by peptides.

| Test | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **IGF-1** | Gold standard for GH activity  -  critical for GH secretagogues. |
| **Testosterone (free/total)** | Androgen levels  -  peptides like ipamorelin can affect this. |
| **Thyroid (TSH, free T3/T4)** | Metabolism regulation  -  some peptides impact thyroid function. |
| **Cortisol** | Stress hormone  -  elevated levels can indicate overtraining or HPA axis dysfunction. |

### Lipid Panel

Measures cholesterol and triglycerides. Important for GLP-1 peptides, which can affect lipid metabolism.

| Test | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **LDL** | "Bad" cholesterol  -  high levels increase cardiovascular risk. |
| **HDL** | "Good" cholesterol  -  higher is better. |
| **Triglycerides** | Fat in blood  -  elevated levels can indicate metabolic syndrome. |

### Inflammation Markers

Key for healing peptides like BPC-157 or TB-500.

| Test | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **CRP** | General inflammation  -  high levels suggest systemic issues. |
| **ESR** | Inflammation over time  -  slower to change than CRP. |

## Peptide-Specific Panels

Different peptides require different monitoring. Here’s what to track based on your protocol.

### GH Secretagogues (e.g., GHRP-2, <a href="/articles/ipamorelin-complete-guide">Ipamorelin</a>, <a href="/articles/cjc-1295-dac-guide">CJC-1295</a>)

These peptides increase GH and IGF-1. Monitor:

- **IGF-1**  -  the best marker for GH activity. Draw **fasted, mid-cycle**.
- **Glucose**  -  GH can raise blood sugar. Test **fasted and post-dose**.
- **Insulin**  -  GH antagonizes insulin; monitor for resistance.

### GLP-1 Agonists (e.g., <a href="/articles/semaglutide-weight-loss-guide">Semaglutide</a>, <a href="/articles/tirzepatide-complete-guide">Tirzepatide</a>)

These peptides affect blood sugar and metabolism. Monitor:

- **A1c**  -  3-month average blood sugar. Test every **3 months**.
- **Fasting glucose**  -  check for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
- **Lipids**  -  GLP-1s can improve or worsen cholesterol.
- **Liver enzymes**  -  some GLP-1s are metabolized by the liver.

### Healing Peptides (e.g., <a href="/articles/bpc-157-complete-guide">BPC-157</a>, <a href="/articles/tb-500-complete-guide">TB-500</a>)

These peptides modulate inflammation. Monitor:

- **CRP**  -  acute inflammation marker. Test **mid-cycle**.
- **ESR**  -  slower inflammation indicator.
- **CBC**  -  check for immune system changes.

## Timing of Labs

When you draw blood affects results. Follow these guidelines:

- **Fasted labs:** Draw after 8-12 hours of fasting (no food, only water). Includes glucose, lipids, IGF-1.
- **Post-dose labs:** For GH secretagogues, draw 2-3 hours after injection to capture peak IGF-1.
- **Mid-cycle labs:** For longer protocols, test at the 4-6 week mark to catch trends.
- **Post-cycle labs:** After stopping, test to ensure biomarkers return to baseline.

## How to Read Your Results

Reference ranges vary by lab. Here’s a general guide:

| Test | Optimal Range | Red Flags |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **ALT/AST** | <30 U/L | >100 U/L (stop peptides) |
| **IGF-1** | 150-300 ng/mL | >400 ng/mL (reduce dose) |
| **Glucose** | 70-99 mg/dL (fasted) | <60 or >126 mg/dL |
| **A1c** | <5.7% | >6.5% (diabetes range) |

> **Key Finding:** Always compare results to your baseline, not just the lab’s reference range.

## Red Flags: When to Stop

Certain results mean you should **discontinue peptides immediately** and consult a doctor:

- **ALT/AST >100 U/L**  -  indicates significant liver stress.
- **Creatinine >1.3 mg/dL (men) or >1.1 mg/dL (women)**  -  suggests kidney impairment.
- **IGF-1 >400 ng/mL**  -  risk of acromegaly or uncontrolled growth.
- **Severe hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL)**  -  especially with GLP-1 peptides.

## Cost of Panels: Cash Pay vs. Insurance

Lab costs vary widely. Here’s a rough estimate:

| Panel | Cash Pay | Insurance (with copay) |
|-------|---------|-----------------------|
| **CMP** | $30-$50 | $10-$30 |
| **CBC** | $20-$40 | $5-$20 |
| **IGF-1** | $80-$120 | $50-$100 |
| **Lipid Panel** | $40-$60 | $10-$30 |

**Where to order:**
- **HealthLabs**  -  affordable cash pay options.
- **Quest Diagnostics**  -  widespread locations, accepts insurance.
- **LabCorp**  -  similar to Quest, often cheaper for cash pay.

## Monitoring Schedule by Protocol Length

How often to test depends on your peptide and cycle length.

### Short Cycles (4-8 Weeks)

- **Baseline:** Before starting.
- **Mid-cycle:** Week 4.
- **Post-cycle:** 2 weeks after stopping.

### Long Cycles (12+ Weeks)

- **Baseline:** Before starting.
- **Every 6 weeks:** Monitor trends.
- **Post-cycle:** 4 weeks after stopping.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I get bloodwork on peptides?

For most protocols, **every 4-6 weeks** is ideal. Short cycles may only need pre- and post-cycle labs.

### Can I use my regular doctor for these tests?

Yes, but you may need to advocate for specific panels. Some doctors are unfamiliar with peptide monitoring.

### What’s the most important test for GH secretagogues?

**IGF-1**  -  it’s the best proxy for GH activity. Test fasted and mid-cycle.

### Do I need fasted labs for peptides?

Yes, for glucose, lipids, and IGF-1. Other tests (like CBC) can be drawn non-fasted.

### What’s the cheapest way to get labs?

**Cash pay panels** from HealthLabs or DirectLabs often cost less than insurance copays for the same tests.

### Can peptides affect thyroid function?

Some peptides (like ipamorelin) may indirectly influence thyroid hormones. Monitor TSH, free T3, and free T4.

### What if my liver enzymes are high?

**Stop peptides immediately** and investigate the cause. High ALT/AST can indicate liver stress or damage.

### How do I interpret IGF-1 results?

Compare to your baseline. Levels **>400 ng/mL** suggest excessive GH activity and warrant dose reduction.

## The Bottom Line

Bloodwork is the **only way** to use peptides safely and effectively. Skipping labs is like driving blindfolded  -  you might get lucky, but the risks aren’t worth it.
