## Understanding the Cognition Stack

The cognition stack brings together three compounds with complementary mechanisms. Each peptide addresses specific cognitive needs while working synergistically with the others.

| Peptide | Primary Function | Secondary Effects |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Semax** | Focus and neuroprotection | Mood elevation, mental clarity |
| **Selank** | Stress reduction | Immune support, emotional balance |
| **Dihexa** | Memory formation | Neuroplasticity, synapse support |

This combination creates a well-rounded approach to cognitive enhancement:

- **Attention systems** receive support through neurotrophic factors
- **Stress response pathways** are modulated for better resilience
- **Memory consolidation processes** are enhanced at the synaptic level

For those exploring individual peptides, our guides on [Semax](/articles/semax-nootropic-peptide-guide) and [Dihexa](/articles/dihexa-nootropic-peptide-guide) provide more detail.

## How Each Peptide Works

### Semax: Focus and Neuroprotection

Semax is a modified peptide fragment derived from ACTH. It influences brain function through several pathways:

- **Supports BDNF production** - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor helps maintain neuron health and supports neuroplasticity
- **Modulates melanocortin receptors** - Affecting alertness and attention pathways for improved concentration
- **Provides antioxidant support** - Protecting brain cells from oxidative stress and environmental toxins
- **Enhances cerebral blood flow** - Potentially improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to brain tissue

Research shows promising results for Semax:

> **Research Insight:** 
> A 2004 study in rats showed Semax reduced brain damage after induced ischemia by 30-50% compared to control groups. Human studies suggest it may improve attention in children with attention deficits.

### Selank: Calm and Cognitive Stability

Selank is a peptide that supports balanced neurotransmitter activity:

- **Modulates GABA systems** - Helping reduce excessive neural firing associated with anxiety
- **Supports serotonin pathways** - Contributing to mood stability and emotional resilience
- **Influences immune response** - Potentially affecting stress resilience through cytokine regulation
- **Enhances learning and memory** - Particularly under stressful conditions

Users typically notice reduced anxiety without sedation, making it suitable for daytime use. The effects are often described as a "calm focus" that supports productivity.

### Dihexa: Memory and Synaptic Support

Dihexa has a unique mechanism focused on memory formation:

- **Activates hepatocyte growth factor pathways** - Supporting synapse formation and maintenance
- **Crosses the blood-brain barrier** - Unlike larger growth factors, allowing direct brain access
- **Enhances long-term potentiation** - The cellular process underlying memory formation
- **Promotes neurogenesis** - Particularly in hippocampal regions important for learning

> **Research Finding:**
> Animal studies suggest Dihexa might help with cognitive challenges associated with aging, including improved maze navigation in older rats. It restored cognitive function in Alzheimer's-like conditions at doses much lower than other cognitive enhancers.

## Practical Usage Guidelines

### Administration Methods and Timing

Different administration methods optimize each peptide's effects:

| Peptide | Recommended Route | Best Time | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Semax** | Nasal spray | Morning/early afternoon | Avoid late dosing to prevent sleep disruption |
| **Selank** | Nasal spray | As needed throughout day | Can use before stressful events |
| **Dihexa** | Subcutaneous injection | Morning | Consistent daily timing recommended |

### Dosing Recommendations

Individual needs vary, but these ranges represent common effective doses:

| Peptide | Starting Dose | Effective Range | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| **Semax** | 300 mcg | 400-800 mcg/day | Split doses if exceeding 600 mcg |
| **Selank** | 200 mcg | 300-600 mcg/day | Higher doses for acute stress |
| **Dihexa** | 1 mg | 2-4 mg/day | Start low due to potency |

### Cycling and Long-Term Use

Regular breaks help maintain effectiveness and reduce potential tolerance:

```
Standard Cycle:
[Weeks 1-6] Daily use → [Weeks 7-8] Break → Repeat

Extended Cycle (after 3 standard cycles):
[Weeks 1-4] Daily use → [Weeks 5-12] Break
```

Considerations for cycling:

- Listen to your body's response
- Avoid stacking during break periods
- Monitor for diminished effects over time
- Extend breaks if benefits decrease

## Safety Profile and Side Effect Management

Most users experience minimal side effects when using appropriate doses:

| Potential Effect | Frequency | Management Strategies |
|------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Nasal irritation | Common | Saline rinse after dosing, rotate nostrils |
| Mild headache | Occasional | Hydration, magnesium supplementation, reduce dose |
| Temporary anxiety | Rare with Selank | Adjust Selank dose upward, breathing exercises |
| Sleep disruption | Rare with proper timing | Avoid afternoon Semax, add magnesium at night |

### Important Considerations

- Blood pressure monitoring is wise during initial use
- Dihexa occasionally causes vivid dreams - typically not problematic
- Gradual dose escalation helps identify tolerance thresholds

> **Medical Notice:**
> The information provided is for educational purposes only. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have existing health conditions or take medications. Peptides should not replace medical treatment for cognitive disorders.
