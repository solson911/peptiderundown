# How to Reconstitute Peptides: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide

If you've just received your first vial of peptides, you're probably staring at a tiny amount of powder and wondering what to do next. Don't worry. Reconstitution sounds intimidating, but it's actually straightforward once you understand the process.

This guide walks you through everything: what reconstitution is, what you need, how to do it step by step, how to calculate your doses, and how to store your peptides properly. By the end, you'll feel confident handling the process like you've done it a hundred times.


## What Is Reconstitution (and Why Is It Necessary)?

Reconstitution simply means **adding a liquid (solvent) to a powdered substance to turn it into an injectable solution**. That's it. You're dissolving the powder so it can be measured and administered accurately.

Peptides are shipped as a freeze-dried (lyophilized) powder because they're far more stable in that form. In powder form, peptides can survive shipping and sit on a shelf without degrading. But you can't inject a powder, so you need it in liquid form first.

Think of it like powdered drink mix. The powder is shelf-stable and easy to transport. But to actually drink it, you need to add water. Same concept, just with more precision and sterility.

### Why not ship them pre-mixed?

Once peptides are in solution, they start a slow countdown. Light, temperature, and even gentle agitation can degrade them over time. Keeping them as powder until you're ready to use them maximizes their potency and shelf life.


## What You'll Need

Before you start, gather everything so you're not scrambling mid-process. Here's your supply list:

### Essential Supplies

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Peptide vial** | Your lyophilized (freeze-dried) peptide |
| **Bacteriostatic water (BAC water)** | The solvent: sterile water containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative |
| **Insulin syringes (1mL / 100 unit)** | For drawing doses after reconstitution |
| **Larger syringe (1–3mL) with needle** | For adding BAC water to the vial (a 25–27 gauge needle works well) |
| **Alcohol swabs** | For sterilizing vial tops before puncturing |

### Nice to Have

- **Syringe filter (0.22μm)** : For extra filtration if desired
- **Sharps container**, for safe needle disposal
- **Gloves**, nitrile, for keeping things clean
- **Clean workspace**, a wiped-down table or counter is fine

### A Note on Bacteriostatic Water vs. Sterile Water

You'll see two options: **bacteriostatic water** and **plain sterile water**. Here's the difference:

- **Bacteriostatic water** contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol, which prevents bacterial growth. This means you can draw from the vial multiple times over days or weeks without contamination. **This is what you want for multi-use vials.**
- **Sterile water** has no preservative. Once punctured, it should be used within 24 hours. Only use this for single-use applications.

For almost everyone reading this, **bacteriostatic water is the right choice**.


## Step-by-Step: How to Reconstitute Peptides

Alright, let's do this. Take your time; there's no rush.

### Step 1: Wash Your Hands

Start with clean hands. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you have nitrile gloves, put them on. This isn't surgery, but you are working with something that's going into your body, so basic hygiene matters.

### Step 2: Gather and Inspect Your Supplies

Lay everything out on a clean surface. Check your peptide vial. You should see a small disc or puck of powder at the bottom (or sometimes clinging to the sides). This is normal. Also check that your BAC water is clear with no particles floating in it.

### Step 3: Decide How Much Bacteriostatic Water to Add

This is where a little math comes in, but it's simple. The amount of BAC water you add determines the **concentration** of your solution, which affects how easy it is to measure your doses.

**Common reconstitution volumes:**

- **5mg vial + 2mL BAC water** = 2.5 mg/mL
- **5mg vial + 1mL BAC water** = 5 mg/mL
- **10mg vial + 2mL BAC water** = 5 mg/mL
- **10mg vial + 5mL BAC water** = 2 mg/mL

There's no single "correct" amount. It depends on your peptide, your dose, and your preference. We'll cover the math in detail in the next section. For now, just know how much you plan to add before you start.

**General rule of thumb:** Add enough water so that your typical dose falls between 5 and 50 units on an insulin syringe. This makes it easy to measure accurately.

### Step 4: Sterilize the Vial Tops

Take an alcohol swab and wipe the rubber stopper on your peptide vial. Do the same for your BAC water vial. Let them air dry for a few seconds. This removes any surface bacteria or dust.

### Step 5: Draw the Bacteriostatic Water

Using your larger syringe (1–3mL), draw up your predetermined amount of BAC water:

1. Insert the needle through the rubber stopper of the BAC water vial.
2. Flip the vial upside down.
3. Pull the plunger back to your desired volume.
4. Remove any air bubbles by tapping the syringe and gently pushing the plunger until the air escapes.
5. Withdraw the needle from the BAC water vial.

### Step 6: Add the Water to the Peptide Vial (Slowly!)

This is the most important step, and the one most people mess up. **Do not squirt the water directly onto the powder.**

Here's the right way:

1. Insert the needle through the rubber stopper of the peptide vial at a slight angle.
2. **Aim the needle toward the inside wall of the vial**, not directly at the powder cake.
3. **Push the plunger slowly.** Let the water trickle down the glass wall and pool at the bottom. This should take 30–60 seconds for 1–2mL.
4. Once all the water is in, remove the needle.

**Why so gentle?** Peptides are delicate molecules. Blasting them with a jet of water can damage their structure through shear force. Think of it like slowly pouring water over a sugar cube versus hitting it with a pressure washer. Both dissolve it, but one is much kinder.

### Step 7: Let It Dissolve (Don't Shake)!

After adding the water, set the vial down and let it sit. Most peptides will dissolve within **2–5 minutes** on their own. You'll see the powder slowly disappear as the solution becomes clear.

**If it's taking a while:**
- Gently roll the vial between your palms. Think slow, easy rotations.
- You can also gently **swirl** the vial in small circles.
- **Never shake the vial.** Shaking creates foam and can denature (damage) the peptide.

The solution should be **clear** when fully dissolved. If it's cloudy or has visible particles after 10 minutes of gentle swirling, something may be wrong. Don't use it.

### Step 8: You're Done!

That's it. Your peptide is now reconstituted and ready to use. Label the vial with the date, the peptide name, and the concentration (e.g., "BPC-157, 2.5mg/mL, Feb 13, 2026"), then store it in the refrigerator.


## How to Calculate Your Concentration and Dose

This is where people get tripped up, but the math is dead simple once you see the pattern.

### The Basic Formula

**Concentration = Amount of peptide ÷ Volume of water added**

That's it. Let's run through some examples.

### Example 1: Simple Calculation

- **Vial:** 5mg of BPC-157
- **Water added:** 2mL of BAC water
- **Concentration:** 5mg ÷ 2mL = **2.5 mg/mL**

If your dose is 250mcg (0.25mg), you need:
- 0.25mg ÷ 2.5mg/mL = 0.1mL = **10 units** on an insulin syringe

### Example 2: Larger Vial

- **Vial:** 10mg of peptide
- **Water added:** 2mL of BAC water
- **Concentration:** 10mg ÷ 2mL = **5 mg/mL**

If your dose is 500mcg (0.5mg):
- 0.5mg ÷ 5mg/mL = 0.1mL = **10 units** on an insulin syringe

### Example 3: More Water for Easier Measurement

- **Vial:** 5mg of peptide
- **Water added:** 2.5mL of BAC water
- **Concentration:** 5mg ÷ 2.5mL = **2 mg/mL**

If your dose is 100mcg (0.1mg):
- 0.1mg ÷ 2mg/mL = 0.05mL = **5 units** on an insulin syringe

### Understanding Insulin Syringe Units

A standard **1mL insulin syringe** has **100 units** total. Each unit = 0.01mL. So:

| Volume (mL) | Insulin Syringe Units |
|---|---|
| 0.05 mL | 5 units |
| 0.10 mL | 10 units |
| 0.20 mL | 20 units |
| 0.25 mL | 25 units |
| 0.50 mL | 50 units |
| 1.00 mL | 100 units |

### The Quick Dose Formula

**Units to draw = (Dose in mg ÷ Concentration in mg/mL) × 100**

Or if you prefer working in micrograms:

**Units to draw = (Dose in mcg ÷ (Concentration in mg/mL × 1000)) × 100**

**Pro tip:** If the math feels confusing, add a "round" amount of water that makes the concentration a clean number. For example, adding 2mL to a 5mg vial gives you 2.5mg/mL, which is easy to work with. Adding 1.73mL would give you 2.89mg/mL, which is unnecessarily annoying.


## How to Draw Your Dose from a Reconstituted Vial

Once your peptide is mixed, here's how to draw your dose each time:

1. **Wipe the vial stopper** with an alcohol swab.
2. **Draw air** into the insulin syringe equal to the amount you plan to withdraw (e.g., if drawing 10 units of liquid, pull 10 units of air).
3. **Insert the needle** through the rubber stopper.
4. **Inject the air** into the vial. This equalizes pressure and makes drawing easier.
5. **Flip the vial upside down** with the syringe still in it.
6. **Pull the plunger** slowly to your desired dose.
7. **Check for air bubbles.** If you see any, tap the syringe barrel to float them to the top, then push the plunger slightly to expel them.
8. **Withdraw the needle** from the vial.

Your dose is now ready for administration. Use a fresh insulin syringe each time. Never reuse needles.


## Storage After Reconstitution

Proper storage is crucial. You went through the effort of reconstituting correctly, so don't let poor storage ruin your peptide.

### The Rules

- **Refrigerate immediately** after reconstitution. Store at **36–46°F (2–8°C)**. Your standard refrigerator is perfect.
- **Keep the vial upright** to minimize contact between the solution and the rubber stopper.
- **Protect from light.** Keep the vial in its box or wrap it in foil. Light degrades many peptides.
- **Don't freeze** reconstituted peptides. Freezing can damage the molecular structure.
- **Shelf life:** Most reconstituted peptides (in BAC water) remain stable for **21–28 days** when refrigerated. Some more robust peptides may last longer, but 3–4 weeks is a safe general guideline.

### Unreconstituted Storage

If you haven't mixed your peptide yet:

- **Room temperature:** Most lyophilized peptides are stable for weeks to months.
- **Refrigerator:** Extends shelf life significantly, lasting months to a year or more.
- **Freezer:** Best for long-term storage of unreconstituted peptides, and can last a year or more.


## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learning from other people's mistakes is the best kind of learning. Here are the most common ones:

### 1. Shooting Water Directly onto the Powder
We covered this, but it's worth repeating. Aim for the vial wall, let the water trickle down. Direct force can damage the peptide.

### 2. Shaking the Vial
Shaking creates bubbles and can denature the peptide. Gentle rolling or swirling only. Patience is your friend.

### 3. Using the Wrong Solvent
Bacteriostatic water is standard for most peptides. Some peptides require specific solvents like acetic acid or DMSO. Always check the documentation for your specific peptide before reconstituting.

### 4. Not Sterilizing Vial Tops
Every time you pierce a rubber stopper, wipe it with an alcohol swab first. Every. Single. Time. It takes two seconds and prevents contamination.

### 5. Reusing Needles
Needles dull after a single use. A dull needle causes more tissue damage and increases infection risk. Insulin syringes are inexpensive, so use a fresh one each time.

### 6. Leaving Reconstituted Peptides at Room Temperature
Reconstituted peptides degrade rapidly at room temperature. Get them back in the fridge as soon as you've drawn your dose.

### 7. Math Errors on Dosing
Double-check your concentration calculation and your dose calculation every time, especially when starting out. Getting the decimal in the wrong place means a 10x dosing error.

### 8. Using Too Little Water
If you add very little water (e.g., 0.5mL to a 10mg vial), the concentration becomes very high (20mg/mL), and a tiny measurement error translates to a huge dose error. Use enough water that your dose lands in a comfortable, measurable range on the syringe.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does reconstituted peptide last?

Generally **21–28 days** when stored properly in the refrigerator with bacteriostatic water. If you used plain sterile water (no preservative), use it within **24 hours**.

### Can I use regular water?

**No.** Tap water, bottled water, and distilled water are not sterile and contain no preservatives. Use only bacteriostatic water or sterile water from a sealed, medical-grade vial.

### What if the solution is cloudy after mixing?

A fully reconstituted peptide should be **clear**. Slight cloudiness that resolves with gentle swirling is normal. Persistent cloudiness, visible particles, or discoloration means something is wrong. Do not use it.

### Does it matter how much BAC water I add?

The total amount of peptide stays the same regardless of how much water you add; you're just changing the concentration. More water = lower concentration = more volume per dose. Less water = higher concentration = less volume per dose. Choose a volume that makes your dose easy to measure.

### Can I travel with reconstituted peptides?

Reconstituted peptides need to stay refrigerated. For short trips, an insulated bag with ice packs can work. For longer travel, consider bringing unreconstituted vials and BAC water separately, and reconstituting at your destination.

### What size syringe should I use for reconstitution vs. dosing?

- **Reconstitution:** Use a **1–3mL syringe** with a standard needle (25–27 gauge). The larger barrel makes it easier to measure 1–2mL of water.
- **Dosing:** Use a **1mL (100 unit) insulin syringe** with a 29–31 gauge needle. The fine markings allow precise dose measurement, and the thin needle minimizes discomfort.

### What if I added the wrong amount of water?

Don't panic. Your peptide is fine; you've just changed the concentration. Recalculate using the actual amount of water you added. For example, if you meant to add 2mL but added 3mL to a 5mg vial, your concentration is 5mg ÷ 3mL = 1.67 mg/mL. Adjust your dose volumes accordingly.

### Can I add more water after reconstituting?

Yes. If you realize your concentration is too high and you want to dilute it further, you can add more BAC water. Just recalculate your new concentration using the total volume of water. For example: 5mg vial + initial 1mL + additional 1mL = 5mg in 2mL = 2.5mg/mL.

### My peptide powder looks like it collapsed or moved in the vial. Is it still good?

This can happen during shipping due to temperature changes or pressure. As long as the vial's seal is intact and the powder hasn't been exposed to moisture, it should be fine. Reconstitute normally.


## Wrapping Up

Reconstituting peptides is one of those things that seems complicated until you do it once. The process is simple: add water to powder, let it dissolve, do some basic math, and store it properly. The key principles are **be gentle, be clean, and be precise**.

Take your time the first couple of times. Write down your concentration and keep notes on your vials. Within a week, this will feel like second nature.
