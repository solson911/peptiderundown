Understanding peptide dosing is essential for safe and effective use. Many people find peptide math confusing at first. This guide simplifies the calculations step by step.

Working with peptides requires careful measurement. Small errors can lead to ineffective results or safety concerns. We'll show you how to calculate doses accurately every time.

***

## Understanding Peptide Vials and Diluents
Peptides come as freeze-dried powders in sealed vials. You must mix them with liquid before use. Bacteriostatic water is the preferred mixing solution.

Bacteriostatic water contains a small amount of alcohol. This prevents bacteria growth during multiple uses. Never use plain sterile water for peptides that require multiple doses.

> **Key Insight:** Always use bacteriostatic water for multi-dose peptides. It contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol to prevent contamination during storage.

Common peptide vial sizes are 2mg, 5mg, and 10mg. The amount of water you add determines concentration. More water means lower concentration and easier measurement.

***

## Reconstitution Math Fundamentals
Reconstitution means mixing the powder with liquid. The concentration formula is simple. It's total peptide amount divided by water volume.

**Concentration (mg/mL) = Peptide amount in vial (mg) / Water volume (mL)**

This tells you how much peptide is in each milliliter of liquid. Higher concentrations mean smaller doses. Lower concentrations mean larger, easier-to-measure doses.

> **Practical Tip:** For beginners, use more water. It makes measuring small doses much easier and reduces errors.

### Insulin Syringe Basics
Most peptides are measured using insulin syringes. These come in different types. U-100 syringes are most common.

| Syringe Type | Total Units | Volume Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| U-100 | 100 units | 1 mL (1000 μL) |
| U-40 | 40 units | 1 mL |
| U-50 | 50 units | 1 mL |

Each unit on a U-100 syringe equals 0.01mL. That's 10 microliters. This precision is essential for small peptide doses.

***

## Dose Calculation Formula
Calculating your dose requires two steps. First determine concentration. Then calculate the volume needed for your dose.

**Dose volume (mL) = Desired dose (mg) / Concentration (mg/mL)**

Convert this to syringe units:

**Syringe units = Dose volume (mL) × 100 (for U-100 syringes)**

### Reconstitution Guide Table
This table shows common reconstitution options. It helps you choose the right water amount.

| Peptide Amount | Bacteriostatic Water | Concentration |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 2mg | 1 mL | 2 mg/mL |
| 5mg | 1 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 5mg | 2 mL | 2.5 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 1 mL | 10 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 2 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 15mg | 3 mL | 5 mg/mL |

> **Measurement Tip:** Always use the same units throughout calculations. Convert mcg to mg before starting (1 mg = 1000 mcg).

## Step-by-Step Calculation Examples
Let's walk through real examples. We'll calculate doses for popular peptides.

### BPC-157 Dose Calculation
Suppose you have a 5mg vial of BPC-157. Your desired dose is 500mcg (0.5mg).

1. Add 2mL bacteriostatic water to vial
2. Concentration = 5mg / 2mL = 2.5 mg/mL
3. Dose volume = 0.5mg / 2.5 mg/mL = 0.2 mL
4. U-100 syringe units = 0.2 × 100 = 20 units

### Semaglutide Starter Dose
You have a 2mg vial. The starting dose is 0.25mg.

1. Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration = 2mg / 1mL = 2 mg/mL
3. Dose volume = 0.25mg / 2 mg/mL = 0.125 mL
4. U-100 syringe units = 0.125 × 100 = 12.5 units

### Ipamorelin Micro-Dose
For a 200mcg dose from a 5mg vial:

1. Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration = 5mg/mL
3. Convert dose: 200mcg = 0.2mg
4. Dose volume = 0.2mg / 5 mg/mL = 0.04 mL
5. U-100 syringe units = 4 units

> **Precision Note:** For very small doses like 4 units, use syringes with half-unit markings. They allow more accurate measurement.

### TB-500 Standard Dose
Calculating 2mg dose from 10mg vial:

1. Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration = 10mg/mL
3. Dose volume = 2mg / 10mg/mL = 0.2 mL
4. U-100 syringe units = 20 units

| Peptide | Typical Dose | Vial Size | Water | Syringe Units |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| BPC-157 | 500 mcg | 5mg | 2 mL | 20 |
| TB-500 | 2 mg | 10mg | 1 mL | 20 |
| Ipamorelin | 200 mcg | 5mg | 1 mL | 4 |
| CJC-1295 | 1 mg | 5mg | 1 mL | 20 |
| GHRP-2 | 150 mcg | 5mg | 2 mL | 6 |
| Semaglutide | 0.25 mg | 2mg | 1 mL | 12.5 |
| PT-141 | 1.75 mg | 10mg | 2 mL | 35 |

## Common Dosing Mistakes
Many errors come from unit confusion. Micrograms and milligrams look similar but differ greatly. Always double-check your conversions.

Using the wrong syringe type causes problems. U-40 and U-100 syringes aren't interchangeable. Using one for the other leads to significant dosing errors.

> **Safety Reminder:** Always consult your healthcare provider before starting peptides. They can help determine appropriate dosing for your needs.

Storage mistakes reduce peptide effectiveness. Most reconstituted peptides need refrigeration. Freezing can damage some peptides. Always follow storage guidelines.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do reconstituted peptides last?
Most remain stable 4-6 weeks when refrigerated. Some last longer. Always check manufacturer guidelines. Discard if solution becomes cloudy or develops particles.

### Can I use sterile water instead?
Bacteriostatic water is essential for multi-dose vials. Sterile water lacks preservatives. It's only suitable for single-use immediate injections.

### Why are my dose volumes so small?
Peptides are highly potent. Many doses are in micrograms. This requires precise measurement. Using more water creates larger, easier-to-measure volumes.

### How do I measure half units?
Use insulin syringes with half-unit markings. They allow precise 0.5 unit measurements. This is essential for accurate micro-dosing.

### Can I mix peptides in one syringe?
Only with compatible combinations. Some peptides interact poorly. When uncertain, use separate syringes. Consult reliable sources about peptide compatibility.

### What if I draw too much?
Never inject excess peptide solution. Safely discard and prepare a new dose. It's better to waste a small amount than risk overdose.

### How should I store peptide vials?
Unreconstituted vials should be refrigerated. Some peptides require freezing. Always follow storage instructions. Protect peptides from light exposure.

### Can I reuse needles?
Never reuse needles. This causes contamination and infection risk. Always use fresh sterile needles for each injection.

## Best Practices for Safe Dosing
Label all vials clearly. Include reconstitution date and concentration. This prevents confusion and dosing errors later.

Rotate injection sites regularly. This prevents tissue irritation. Common sites include abdomen, thighs, and upper arms.

Keep a dosing journal. Record dates, doses, and observations. This helps track effectiveness and notice patterns.

Always use alcohol swabs. Clean vial tops before drawing. Clean skin before injecting. This prevents infection.

## When to Seek Professional Guidance
Consult a healthcare provider if you experience unexpected effects. They can help adjust dosing or identify issues.

If you have medical conditions or take medications, get professional advice. Peptides can interact with certain health conditions and drugs.

Regular blood work helps monitor health markers. Some peptides affect hormone levels or other biomarkers. Professional supervision ensures safety.
