Understanding peptide dosing is essential for safe and effective use. Many people find peptide math confusing at first. This guide simplifies the calculations step by step.

Working with peptides requires careful measurement. Small errors can lead to ineffective results or safety concerns. We'll show you how to calculate doses accurately every time.

***

## Understanding Peptide Vials and Diluents
Peptides come as freeze-dried powders in sealed vials. You must mix them with liquid before use. Bacteriostatic water is the preferred mixing solution.

Bacteriostatic water contains a small amount of alcohol. This prevents bacteria growth during multiple uses. Never use plain sterile water for peptides that require multiple doses.

> **Key Insight:** Always use bacteriostatic water for multi-dose peptides. It contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol to prevent contamination during storage.

Common peptide vial sizes are 2mg, 5mg, and 10mg. The amount of water you add determines concentration. More water means lower concentration and easier measurement.

***

## Reconstitution Math Fundamentals
Reconstitution means mixing the powder with liquid. The concentration formula is simple. It's total peptide amount divided by water volume.

**Concentration (mg/mL) = Peptide amount in vial (mg) / Water volume (mL)**

This tells you how much peptide is in each milliliter of liquid. Higher concentrations mean smaller doses. Lower concentrations mean larger, easier-to-measure doses.

> **Practical Tip:** For beginners, use more water. It makes measuring small doses much easier and reduces errors.

### Insulin Syringe Basics
Most peptides are measured using insulin syringes. These come in different types. U-100 syringes are most common.

| Syringe Type | Total Units | Volume Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| U-100 | 100 units | 1 mL (1000 μL) |
| U-40 | 40 units | 1 mL |
| U-50 | 50 units | 1 mL |

Each unit on a U-100 syringe equals 0.01mL. That's 10 microliters. This precision is essential for small peptide doses.

***

## Dose Calculation Formula
Calculating your dose requires two steps. First determine concentration. Then calculate the volume needed for your dose.

**Dose volume (mL) = Desired dose (mg) / Concentration (mg/mL)**

Convert this to syringe units:

**Syringe units = Dose volume (mL) × 100 (for U-100 syringes)**

### Reconstitution Guide Table
This table shows common reconstitution options. It helps you choose the right water amount.

| Peptide Amount | Bacteriostatic Water | Concentration |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 2mg | 1 mL | 2 mg/mL |
| 5mg | 1 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 5mg | 2 mL | 2.5 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 1 mL | 10 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 2 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 15mg | 3 mL | 5 mg/mL |

> **Measurement Tip:** Always use the same units throughout calculations. Convert mcg to mg before starting (1 mg = 1000 mcg).

## Step-by-Step Calculation Examples
Let's walk through real examples. We'll calculate doses for popular peptides.

### BPC-157 Dose Calculation
Suppose you have a 5mg vial of BPC-157. Your desired dose is 500mcg (0.5mg).

- Add 2mL bacteriostatic water to vial
- Concentration = 5mg / 2mL = 2.5 mg/mL
- Dose volume = 0.5mg / 2.5 mg/mL = 0.2 mL
- U-100 syringe units = 0.2 × 100 = 20 units

### Semaglutide Starter Dose
You have a 2mg vial. The starting dose is 0.25mg.

- Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
- Concentration = 2mg / 1mL = 2 mg/mL
- Dose volume = 0.25mg / 2 mg/mL = 0.125 mL
- U-100 syringe units = 0.125 × 100 = 12.5 units

### Ipamorelin Micro-Dose
For a 200mcg dose from a 5mg vial:

- Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
- Concentration = 5mg/mL
- Convert dose: 200mcg = 0.2mg
- Dose volume = 0.2mg / 5 mg/mL = 0.04 mL
- U-100 syringe units = 4 units

> **Precision Note:** For very small doses like 4 units, use syringes with half-unit markings. They allow more accurate measurement.

### TB-500 Standard Dose
Calculating 2mg dose from 10mg vial:

- Add 1mL bacteriostatic water
- Concentration = 10mg/mL
- Dose volume = 2mg / 10mg/mL = 0.2 mL
- U-100 syringe units = 20 units

### CJC-1295 Dose from 5mg Vial
For a 1mg dose of CJC-1295:

- Add 1mL bacteriostatic water to 5mg vial
- Concentration = 5mg/mL
- Dose volume = 1mg / 5mg/mL = 0.2mL
- U-100 syringe units = 20 units

### GHRP-2 Dose Calculation
Standard dose: 150mcg from 5mg vial

- Add 2mL bacteriostatic water
- Concentration = 5mg / 2mL = 2.5 mg/mL
- Convert dose: 150mcg = 0.15mg
- Dose volume = 0.15mg / 2.5mg/mL = 0.06mL
- U-100 syringe units = 6 units

## Advanced Measurement Techniques
Reading insulin syringes accurately takes practice. Focus on the plunger tip. Align it precisely with the unit mark.

Air bubbles affect dose accuracy. Remove them by flicking the syringe gently. Push air out before injection.

Precision matters most with micro-doses. For doses under 10 units, consider:

- Using 0.3mL syringes with finer markings
- Concentrating more on plunger position
- Double-checking calculations

When mixing water and peptide, aim for gentle swirling. Avoid shaking vigorously. Aggressive mixing can damage delicate peptides.

***

## Common Dosing Mistakes
Many errors come from unit confusion. Micrograms and milligrams look similar but differ greatly. Always double-check your conversions.

Using the wrong syringe type causes problems. U-40 and U-100 syringes aren't interchangeable. Using one for the other leads to significant dosing errors.

> **Safety Reminder:** Always consult your healthcare provider before starting peptides. They can help determine appropriate dosing for your needs.

Storage mistakes reduce peptide effectiveness. Most reconstituted peptides need refrigeration. Freezing can damage some peptides. Always follow storage guidelines.

Cross-contamination risks are real. Never use the same needle multiple times. Avoid touching sterile surfaces.
