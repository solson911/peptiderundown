Understanding peptide dosing is fundamental to safe, effective use. Calculating reconstitution volumes and syringe measurements can feel intimidating at first. Let's break down the math into simple, practical steps.

## The Building Blocks: Vials and Diluents

Peptides typically come in lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder vials. Common vial sizes are 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg. Bacteriostatic water (water with 0.9% benzyl alcohol) is the standard diluent for reconstitution.

> **Key Finding:** Always use bacteriostatic water - never sterile water. The benzyl alcohol prevents bacterial growth for multi-dose use.

## Reconstitution Math Explained

The basic concentration formula:

**Concentration (mg/mL) = Total peptide amount (mg) / Diluent volume (mL)**

### Understanding Insulin Syringes

Insulin syringes are measured in International Units (IU). Standard sizes:

| Syringe Size | Total Units | Volume Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| U-100 | 100 units | 1 mL (1000 uL) |
| U-40 | 40 units | 1 mL |

> **Key Finding:** U-100 syringes are most common. Each unit marking equals 0.01mL or 10uL.

## Dose Calculation Formula

To find your dose volume:

**Dose volume (mL) = Desired dose (mg) / Concentration (mg/mL)**

Convert to syringe units:

**Syringe units = Dose volume (mL) x 100 (for U-100 syringes)**

## Common Vial Reconstitution Guide

| Peptide Amount | Bacteriostatic Water | Concentration (mg/mL) |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 5mg | 1 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 5mg | 2 mL | 2.5 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 1 mL | 10 mg/mL |
| 10mg | 2 mL | 5 mg/mL |
| 15mg | 3 mL | 5 mg/mL |

## Worked Examples

### BPC-157 (500mcg dose from 5mg vial)

1. Reconstitute 5mg vial with 2mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration: 5mg / 2mL = 2.5mg/mL
3. Convert dose to mg: 500mcg = 0.5mg
4. Volume: 0.5mg / 2.5mg/mL = 0.2mL
5. U-100 syringe: 0.2mL x 100 = **20 units**

### TB-500 (2mg dose from 10mg vial)

1. Reconstitute 10mg vial with 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration: 10mg/mL
3. Volume: 2mg / 10mg/mL = 0.2mL
4. U-100 syringe: **20 units**

> **Key Finding:** Higher water volumes make dosing easier and more precise for beginners.

### Ipamorelin (200mcg dose from 5mg vial)

1. Reconstitute 5mg vial with 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration: 5mg/mL
3. Dose in mg: 200mcg = 0.2mg
4. Volume: 0.2mg / 5mg/mL = 0.04mL
5. U-100 syringe: **4 units**

### CJC-1295 (1mg dose from 10mg vial)

1. Reconstitute 10mg vial with 2mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration: 5mg/mL
3. Volume: 1mg / 5mg/mL = 0.2mL
4. U-100 syringe: **20 units**

### Semaglutide (0.25mg starter dose from 2mg vial)

1. Reconstitute 2mg vial with 1mL bacteriostatic water
2. Concentration: 2mg/mL
3. Volume: 0.25mg / 2mg/mL = 0.125mL
4. U-100 syringe: **12.5 units**

> **Key Finding:** Always double-check your math before drawing a dose. Small errors can lead to significant over/under-dosing.

## Quick-Reference Dosing Table

| Peptide | Common Dose | Vial Size | Water | Syringe Units |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| BPC-157 | 500mcg | 5mg | 2mL | 20 units |
| TB-500 | 2mg | 10mg | 1mL | 20 units |
| Ipamorelin | 200mcg | 5mg | 2mL | 8 units |
| CJC-1295 | 1mg | 5mg | 1mL | 20 units |
| Semaglutide | 0.25mg | 2mg | 1mL | 12.5 units |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Mismatched syringe types** - Using U-40 syringe for U-100 concentration
- **Dose confusion** - Not converting mcg to mg (1mg = 1000mcg)
- **Storage errors** - Not refrigerating reconstituted peptides
- **Cross-contamination** - Reusing needles or diluent vials

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does reconstituted peptide last?

Most peptides remain stable for 4-6 weeks when refrigerated. Always check manufacturer recommendations. Discard if the solution becomes cloudy or discolored.

### Can I use sterile water instead of bacteriostatic water?

No. Bacteriostatic water contains antimicrobial agents that prevent contamination across multiple draws. Sterile water should only be used for single-dose, immediate-use injections.

### Why do my calculations give such small syringe amounts?

Peptides are potent. Many doses are in micrograms, requiring tiny volumes. Using more bacteriostatic water during reconstitution gives you a lower concentration, which means larger and easier-to-measure injection volumes.

### How do I measure half-unit doses?

Use insulin syringes with half-unit markings. These allow precise measurements down to 0.5 units (0.005mL). They're especially useful for peptides like Ipamorelin where doses can fall between whole unit lines.

### Can I pre-mix peptides in the same syringe?

Only with compatible peptides per manufacturer guidelines. Some peptides degrade when combined or precipitate out of solution. When in doubt, use separate syringes.

### What if I draw too much into the syringe?

Never inject excess. Safely discard the syringe and prepare a new dose. Better to waste a small amount of peptide than risk an overdose.

## Final Tips

- **Label everything** - Mark reconstituted vials with date and concentration
- **Swab first** - Use alcohol swabs on vial tops before each draw
- **Rotate sites** - Change injection locations to prevent tissue irritation
- **Keep a journal** - Track doses, timing, and effects
