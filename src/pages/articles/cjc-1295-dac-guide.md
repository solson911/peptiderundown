# CJC-1295 with DAC: Long-Acting Growth Hormone Releaser

If you've spent any time looking into growth hormone peptides, you've probably run into CJC-1295. But there's a catch that trips people up: there are two versions. CJC-1295 with DAC and CJC-1295 without DAC (sometimes called "mod GRF 1-29") are related compounds with very different behavior in the body. This guide is about the DAC version, the one that sticks around for days instead of minutes.

Let's break down what makes this peptide unique, what the research says, and what you should know before considering it.

> **Key Takeaways**
> - CJC-1295 DAC binds to albumin, extending its half-life to 6-8 days (vs. 30 minutes for the no-DAC version)
> - It amplifies natural GH pulses and raises IGF-1 by 36-105%, with only twice-weekly injections needed
> - Benefits include fat loss (especially visceral), better sleep, improved recovery, and skin/connective tissue support
> - Water retention and tingling are the most common side effects; monitor IGF-1 and blood glucose with periodic labs

## What Is CJC-1295 DAC?

CJC-1295 is a synthetic analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Your hypothalamus naturally produces GHRH, which tells the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH). The problem with natural GHRH is that it gets chewed up by enzymes in minutes. It's effective but incredibly short-lived.

Researchers at ConjuChem Biotechnologies solved this by modifying the first 29 amino acids of GHRH (the minimum needed for biological activity) and attaching something called a Drug Affinity Complex, or DAC. This is a reactive chemical group that binds to albumin, the most abundant protein in your blood.

And that albumin binding changes everything.

## How the Drug Affinity Complex (DAC) Extends Half-Life

Here's the basic idea. Once CJC-1295 DAC is injected, the DAC moiety forms a covalent bond with circulating albumin. Albumin has a half-life of roughly 19-21 days in humans. By hitching a ride on albumin, CJC-1295 DAC extends its own half-life from about 30 minutes (for the non-DAC version) to approximately 5.8-8 days ([Teichman et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16352683/)).

This means a single injection can elevate GH levels for nearly a week. Compare that to regular GHRH or the no-DAC version, where you'd need multiple daily injections to get sustained effects. The DAC version was specifically designed for less frequent dosing, which is a big practical advantage.

The albumin binding also protects the peptide from enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which is the enzyme that normally destroys GHRH so quickly.

## How CJC-1295 DAC Stimulates Growth Hormone

CJC-1295 DAC works through the GHRH receptor (GHRHR) on somatotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. When it binds this receptor, it triggers a signaling cascade that leads to GH synthesis and secretion.

A few key points about how this differs from other GH-boosting peptides:

**It amplifies natural pulses.** CJC-1295 DAC doesn't just flood your system with a single GH spike. Research shows it increases both the amplitude and frequency of GH pulses while maintaining the body's natural pulsatile pattern ([Ionescu & Bhatt, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713752/)). This is a critical distinction from exogenous GH injections, which can flatten natural pulsatility.

**It raises IGF-1.** Because GH stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), sustained GH elevation from CJC-1295 DAC also raises IGF-1 levels. The Teichman study found IGF-1 levels increased by 36-105% after single doses, with effects lasting up to 28 days.

**Negative feedback still works.** Somatostatin, the hormone that puts the brakes on GH release, still functions. This provides a safety buffer that you don't get with direct GH injection. Your body can still regulate how much GH actually gets released.

## Benefits: What CJC-1295 DAC Actually Does

Most of the benefits come from the sustained elevation of GH and IGF-1. Here's what the research and clinical experience suggest:

### Fat Loss

Growth hormone is one of the most potent lipolytic hormones in the body. It promotes the breakdown of stored triglycerides and increases fatty acid oxidation. Studies on GH-deficient adults show that GH replacement consistently reduces visceral fat ([Johannsson et al., 1997](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9024231/)). CJC-1295 DAC achieves similar GH elevation through a more physiological pathway.

The sustained nature of the GH elevation with DAC may be particularly useful here. Fat loss from GH isn't an acute effect. It requires consistent elevation over weeks to months. The long half-life of CJC-1295 DAC means you're getting steady GH output between injections.

### Muscle Growth and Recovery

GH and IGF-1 both promote protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. They don't build muscle the way testosterone does, but they create an anabolic environment that supports lean tissue growth, especially when combined with resistance training.

Recovery is where many users report the most noticeable difference. Faster recovery between workouts, reduced muscle soreness, and improved repair from injuries. GH plays a direct role in collagen synthesis and connective tissue repair ([Doessing et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20427735/)).

### Sleep Quality

GH secretion naturally peaks during deep sleep. There's a bidirectional relationship here: good sleep promotes GH release, and adequate GH promotes deeper sleep. Users of CJC-1295 DAC frequently report improved sleep depth and feeling more rested. This isn't just anecdotal. GH-releasing peptides have been shown to increase slow-wave sleep duration ([Frieboes et al., 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7768645/)).

### Skin and Connective Tissue

GH stimulates collagen production, which is why people on GH therapy often notice improved skin elasticity and thickness. This effect takes time, usually 2-3 months of consistent use, but it's one of the more reliable cosmetic benefits. Hair and nail growth may also improve.

### General Recovery and Healing

From joint repair to wound healing, GH accelerates tissue repair processes. This is well-documented in clinical settings ([Herndon et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15273542/)). Athletes and older adults both report that nagging injuries resolve faster with GH-boosting protocols.

## CJC-1295 DAC vs. No-DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)

This is one of the most common questions in the peptide space, so let's be clear about the differences.

| Feature | CJC-1295 DAC | CJC-1295 No-DAC (Mod GRF 1-29) |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Half-life | 5.8-8 days | ~30 minutes |
| Dosing frequency | 2x per week | 2-3x per day |
| GH release pattern | Sustained elevation (GH "bleed") | Sharp pulse, then returns to baseline |
| Convenience | High | Low |
| GH pulsatility | Somewhat blunted between doses | Mimics natural pulse closely |
| Best for | Steady IGF-1 elevation, convenience | Those wanting natural-style GH pulses |

The no-DAC version is often preferred by people who want to preserve the most natural GH pulsatility possible. Because it has such a short half-life, it fires off a GH pulse and then clears, letting the system reset before the next dose.

CJC-1295 DAC, on the other hand, keeps stimulating GH release continuously. Some researchers have raised the concern that this could lead to partial desensitization of somatotroph cells over time, though clinical data hasn't shown this to be a major issue in study durations of several months.

## CJC-1295 DAC vs. Ipamorelin

These two get compared constantly because they're often used together. But they work through completely different mechanisms.

CJC-1295 DAC is a GHRH analog. It acts on the GHRH receptor. Ipamorelin is a growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts on the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a). They stimulate GH release through separate pathways, which is why combining them produces a synergistic effect rather than just an additive one.

Ipamorelin is also selective. For a full breakdown of this pairing, see our [tesamorelin and ipamorelin stack guide](/articles/tesamorelin-ipamorelin-stack-guide). Unlike GHRP-6 or GHRP-2 (other ghrelin mimetics), ipamorelin doesn't significantly raise cortisol or prolactin at normal doses ([Raun et al., 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9849822/)). This makes the CJC-1295 DAC + ipamorelin combination popular: you get the sustained baseline GH elevation from CJC-1295 DAC plus the acute pulses from ipamorelin, without the hunger or cortisol spikes that come with other GHRPs.

## How to Dose CJC-1295 DAC

**Standard dosing:** Most protocols call for 1-2 mg of CJC-1295 DAC injected subcutaneously, twice per week. Some users dose once weekly, but twice weekly tends to produce more stable GH and IGF-1 levels.

**Injection timing:** Because the half-life is so long, timing matters less than it does with short-acting peptides. Some people prefer evening injections to take advantage of the natural nocturnal GH surge. Others inject in the morning with no noticeable difference. Pick a schedule and stay consistent.

**Cycle length:** Common cycles run 8-16 weeks, followed by a break of 4-8 weeks. The reasoning for cycling is to prevent potential receptor desensitization, though evidence for this with CJC-1295 DAC specifically is limited. Some users run it continuously for months.

**Combination dosing:** When stacking with ipamorelin, a typical protocol would be CJC-1295 DAC at 2 mg twice weekly, with ipamorelin at 200-300 mcg 1-3 times daily (usually pre-bed or post-workout). The CJC-1295 DAC provides the baseline, and ipamorelin adds the acute pulses.

**Reconstitution:** CJC-1295 DAC typically comes as a lyophilized powder. Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water. Store reconstituted peptide refrigerated and use within 3-4 weeks. See our [peptide storage guide](/articles/how-to-store-peptides) for details.

## Side Effects

CJC-1295 DAC is generally well-tolerated in studies, but side effects do occur. Most are related to the GH elevation itself rather than the peptide being toxic.

### Common Side Effects

**Water retention.** This is the most frequently reported side effect. GH promotes sodium and water retention, which can cause puffy hands, swollen ankles, or a general feeling of bloating. It's usually dose-dependent and resolves when dosing is reduced or stopped.

**Numbness and tingling.** Carpal tunnel-like symptoms in the hands and fingers are a classic sign of elevated GH. This happens because water retention puts pressure on the median nerve. If this becomes persistent, it's a signal to lower the dose.

**Injection site reactions.** Redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site. These are usually mild and temporary.

**Headaches.** Some users report headaches, particularly in the first week or two. These tend to resolve as the body adjusts.

### Less Common Concerns

**Cortisol and prolactin.** GHRH analogs can cause modest increases in cortisol and prolactin. The Teichman study noted transient cortisol elevations, though they weren't clinically significant. This is more of an issue when stacking with GHRPs that also raise cortisol (like GHRP-6), and less of a concern with CJC-1295 DAC alone or with ipamorelin.

**Blood sugar effects.** GH is a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin. Sustained GH elevation can reduce insulin sensitivity over time. People with existing insulin resistance or diabetes should be cautious and monitor glucose levels.

**Joint pain.** Paradoxically, while GH helps joints long-term, the initial water retention can cause joint discomfort in some users.

### Serious Risks

Long-term effects of sustained GH elevation are a legitimate concern. Chronically high IGF-1 levels have been associated with increased cancer risk in epidemiological studies ([Renehan et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15026468/)). However, the GH levels achieved with CJC-1295 DAC are typically within or slightly above the physiological range, which is quite different from supraphysiological GH dosing.

Anyone with a history of cancer or active malignancy should avoid GH-stimulating peptides. For a broader look at risks, see our [peptide side effects guide](/articles/peptide-side-effects-what-to-know).

## Practical Tips for CJC-1295 DAC Users

**Fasting and food timing.** GH release is blunted by elevated blood sugar and insulin. For the no-DAC version, this matters a lot since you need to time injections away from meals. With the DAC version, the sustained release means you'll get GH output regardless, but some users still prefer to inject on an empty stomach or before bed.

**Lab monitoring.** If using CJC-1295 DAC, it's smart to track IGF-1 levels, fasting glucose, and HbA1c periodically. IGF-1 gives you an objective measure of whether the peptide is working and whether levels are getting too high.

**Storage.** Keep lyophilized (unreconstituted) peptide frozen or refrigerated. Once reconstituted, refrigerate and don't freeze. Avoid shaking the vial; gently swirl instead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How fast does CJC-1295 DAC start working?

GH and IGF-1 levels begin rising within hours of the first injection. But the benefits you'll actually notice, like improved sleep, recovery, and body composition changes, typically take 2-4 weeks to become apparent. Full effects on fat loss and muscle usually develop over 2-3 months.

### Can I use CJC-1295 DAC without combining it with anything?

Yes. It works on its own. But most protocols combine it with a GHS like ipamorelin for synergistic effects. Think of GHRH as the gas pedal and GHS as a turbo boost. They work through different receptors, so the combined effect is greater than either alone.

### Does CJC-1295 DAC suppress natural GH production?

Not in the same way that exogenous GH does. CJC-1295 DAC works through the GHRH receptor, meaning it's still using your pituitary to make GH. Somatostatin feedback remains intact. When you stop the peptide, your pituitary continues functioning normally. There's no "shutdown" analogous to what happens with testosterone and anabolic steroids.

### Is CJC-1295 DAC legal?

CJC-1295 DAC is sold as a research chemical in many countries. It's not approved by the FDA for human use. Legal status varies by jurisdiction. It's banned by WADA and most sports organizations.

### How do I know if my CJC-1295 DAC is real?

Test your IGF-1 before and 2-3 weeks after starting. Genuine CJC-1295 DAC should produce a measurable increase. If IGF-1 doesn't budge, your product may be underdosed or fake. Third-party testing services can also verify peptide identity and purity.

### What's the difference between CJC-1295 DAC and sermorelin?

Both are GHRH analogs, but sermorelin is the original. It has a very short half-life (about 10-20 minutes) and was actually FDA-approved for GH deficiency in children before being discontinued for commercial reasons. CJC-1295 DAC is a more potent, longer-lasting successor. Sermorelin requires daily injections; CJC-1295 DAC needs only twice weekly.

## The Bottom Line

CJC-1295 DAC is one of the most practical GH-releasing peptides available. Its long half-life means fewer injections, more stable GH output, and better compliance compared to short-acting alternatives. The trade-off is less precise control over GH pulsatility compared to the no-DAC version.

It's not a magic bullet. The benefits are real but gradual, and they work best alongside solid training, nutrition, and sleep habits. If you're considering it, start with a low dose, monitor your labs, and pay attention to how your body responds. And as always, work with a knowledgeable healthcare provider who understands peptide therapy.
