# The Metabolic Stack: Tesamorelin + 5-Amino-1MQ + AOD-9604 for Fat Loss

The Metabolic Stack is a powerful combination of three peptides - Tesamorelin, 5-Amino-1MQ, and AOD-9604 - designed to target fat loss and improve body composition through distinct yet complementary mechanisms. This article explores how each compound works, their synergy, dosing protocols, expected results, and more.

## What Each Compound Does Individually

### Tesamorelin

Tesamorelin is a synthetic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH), which in turn increases insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This cascade promotes fat metabolism, particularly in visceral adipose tissue.

> **Key Finding:** Tesamorelin has been shown to reduce visceral fat by up to 15% in clinical studies, making it a standout for targeting stubborn belly fat.

### 5-Amino-1MQ

5-Amino-1MQ is a small molecule inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NNMT is an enzyme that depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a critical cofactor for energy metabolism. By inhibiting NNMT, 5-Amino-1MQ boosts NAD+ levels, enhancing mitochondrial function and fat oxidation.

> **Key Finding:** Research suggests that 5-Amino-1MQ can increase metabolic rate by up to 10%, making it a potent tool for fat loss.

### AOD-9604

AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone (hGH) that mimics the fat-burning properties of hGH without its anabolic or diabetogenic effects. It works by stimulating lipolysis (fat breakdown) and inhibiting lipogenesis (fat storage).

> **Key Finding:** AOD-9604 has been shown to reduce body fat by up to 12% in studies, with minimal side effects.

## How They Synergize Together

The Metabolic Stack combines these three compounds to target fat loss from multiple angles:

- **Tesamorelin** - Increases GH and IGF-1, promoting fat metabolism and muscle preservation.
- **5-Amino-1MQ** - Boosts NAD+ levels, enhancing mitochondrial efficiency and fat oxidation.
- **AOD-9604** - Directly stimulates lipolysis and inhibits fat storage.

Together, they create a multi-pathway approach to fat loss that is more effective than any single compound alone.

## Detailed Dosing Protocol with Timing

Here's a recommended dosing protocol for the Metabolic Stack:

| Compound       | Dosage       | Timing          | Duration |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Tesamorelin    | 1 mg         | Before bedtime  | 8-12 weeks |
| 5-Amino-1MQ    | 100 mg       | Morning         | 8-12 weeks |
| AOD-9604       | 300 mcg      | Post-workout    | 8-12 weeks |

### Notes:
- **Tesamorelin** should be taken at night to align with the body's natural GH pulse.
- **5-Amino-1MQ** is best taken in the morning to maximize its metabolic effects throughout the day.
- **AOD-9604** is most effective post-workout when fat mobilization is already elevated.

## Expected Results Timeline Week by Week

| Week | Expected Changes |
|------|------------------|
| 1-2  | Increased energy, slight reduction in water retention |
| 3-4  | Noticeable fat loss, especially in stubborn areas |
| 5-6  | Improved muscle definition, continued fat loss |
| 7-8  | Significant reduction in body fat, enhanced metabolic rate |
| 9-12 | Peak results, optimal body composition |

## Side Effects for Each Compound

### Tesamorelin

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Joint pain** | Common | Usually mild, resolves within days |
| **Water retention** | Common | Temporary, subsides with continued use |
| **Numbness or tingling** | Occasional | Related to GH elevation |
| **Increased blood sugar** | Rare | Monitor if diabetic or prediabetic |

### 5-Amino-1MQ

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **GI discomfort** | Occasional | Take with food to minimize |
| **Headache** | Occasional | Usually resolves within first week |

### AOD-9604

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Injection site reactions** | Common | Mild redness or swelling |

Overall, this stack has a favorable safety profile compared to many alternatives. None of the three compounds carry the serious risks associated with full-dose growth hormone or stimulant-based fat burners.

## Who This Stack Is For (And Who Should Avoid It)

### Ideal Candidates

- **Stubborn fat carriers** - Especially those with visceral fat that won't budge with diet alone
- **Plateau breakers** - People who've stalled on traditional fat loss programs
- **Muscle-conscious dieters** - Those who want fat loss without sacrificing lean mass
- **Non-stimulant seekers** - Anyone who can't tolerate caffeine-heavy fat burners

### Who Should Avoid

- **Pregnant or breastfeeding women** - insufficient safety data
- **Active cancer patients** - GH-releasing compounds may promote tumor growth
- **Uncontrolled diabetics** - Tesamorelin can affect blood sugar regulation
- **Those with hormone-sensitive conditions** - consult an endocrinologist first

## How It Compares to GLP-1 Agonists

| Feature          | Metabolic Stack | Semaglutide | Retatrutide |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | Multi-targeted fat metabolism | GLP-1 appetite suppression | Triple agonist (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon) |
| **Fat loss type** | Targeted, visceral focus | Generalized weight loss | Generalized + metabolic |
| **Muscle preservation** | Yes | No (significant lean mass loss) | Moderate |
| **Side effects** | Mild | GI issues common | GI issues common |
| **Cost per month** | $200-400 | $800-1,200 (brand) | Limited availability |
| **Administration** | Daily injections + oral | Weekly injection | Weekly injection |

> **Key Finding:** The Metabolic Stack is ideal for those who want targeted fat loss without muscle loss, while GLP-1 agonists are better for appetite control and generalized weight loss. For a deeper look at retatrutide, see our [Retatrutide Complete Guide](/articles/retatrutide-complete-guide).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I run the Metabolic Stack?

Most protocols run 8-12 weeks. Going beyond 12 weeks isn't necessarily dangerous, but the body can adapt to exogenous GH stimulation over time. A 4-week break between cycles helps maintain sensitivity. During the break, you can continue 5-Amino-1MQ if desired since it works through a different pathway.

### Can I stack this with other peptides?

You can, but be thoughtful about it. Avoid combining with other GH-releasing peptides like CJC-1295 or Ipamorelin, since Tesamorelin already covers that pathway. BPC-157 or TB-500 for recovery are fine additions. Some users add a GLP-1 agonist for appetite control, but that significantly increases cost and side effect burden.

### Will I lose muscle on this stack?

No. One of the biggest advantages of this stack over GLP-1 agonists is muscle preservation. Tesamorelin's GH-stimulating effects actively support lean mass, while AOD-9604 targets fat specifically without the anabolic effects that might cause unwanted growth. Pair with resistance training for best results.

### What's the best diet to pair with this stack?

A high-protein diet (1g per pound of bodyweight) with moderate carbs and controlled fats works best. You don't need extreme caloric restriction - a modest 300-500 calorie deficit is enough. The stack handles the metabolic heavy lifting. Protein is non-negotiable though, since it supports muscle retention and thermogenesis.

### Are there any drug interactions I should know about?

5-Amino-1MQ may interact with NAD+ precursors like NMN or NR - the combination could push NAD+ levels too high, though this is largely theoretical. Tesamorelin shouldn't be combined with exogenous GH. If you're on metformin or insulin, monitor glucose closely since Tesamorelin can affect blood sugar regulation.

### How does this compare to traditional fat burners?

Night and day difference. Stimulant-based fat burners work through adrenaline and thermogenesis, causing jitters, crashes, and tolerance buildup. The Metabolic Stack works through hormonal and enzymatic pathways that don't cause stimulant side effects. The trade-off is speed - stimulants work faster but aren't sustainable, while this stack produces steadier, more lasting results.

## The Bottom Line

The Metabolic Stack offers a multi-pathway approach to fat loss that targets visceral fat, boosts cellular metabolism, and directly stimulates fat breakdown - all while preserving muscle mass. It's not the cheapest option, and it requires commitment to a proper protocol. But for those who've hit a plateau or want targeted fat loss without the GI side effects of GLP-1 agonists, this stack delivers.
