# The Metabolic Stack: Tesamorelin + 5-Amino-1MQ + AOD-9604 for Fat Loss

If you look at most fat-loss protocols, they usually do one thing well.
They reduce appetite, or they increase energy expenditure, or they improve nutrient partitioning.

The idea behind the "Metabolic Stack" is to layer three different mechanisms.
Tesamorelin pushes the growth-hormone axis, 5-amino-1MQ targets NNMT and NAD+ metabolism, and AOD-9604 is positioned as a GH-fragment that may bias toward lipolysis.

This is not a prescription.
It is a research-oriented framework, with practical notes on how people structure timing and what to monitor.

## What each compound is doing (in plain language)

### Tesamorelin

Tesamorelin is a GHRH analog.
Rather than acting like growth hormone itself, it signals the pituitary to release GH, which then increases IGF-1 downstream.

In practice, tesamorelin is mainly discussed for body composition because GH signaling tends to shift fuel use, often with an effect on visceral fat in clinical contexts.

If you want the bigger picture of GH-related peptides, start with [CJC-1295](/articles/cjc-1295-dac-guide) and [ipamorelin](/articles/ipamorelin-complete-guide).

### 5-amino-1MQ

5-amino-1MQ is usually described as an NNMT inhibitor.
NNMT is involved in methylation of nicotinamide, and it is often discussed in the context of metabolic efficiency and NAD+ availability.

The "why" for stacking is simple.
If tesamorelin pushes the GH/IGF-1 axis, 5-amino-1MQ is aimed at cellular energy handling and metabolic signaling from a different angle.

For related context, see our primer on [NAD and NAD-related peptides](/articles/nad-peptides-cellular-energy-longevity).

### AOD-9604

AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone.
It is marketed and discussed as a compound that may promote lipolysis without the broader systemic effects people associate with full GH signaling.

Evidence quality and outcomes are mixed depending on the population and endpoint.
If you want compound-specific background, see [AOD-9604](/articles/aod-9604-fat-loss-peptide-guide).

## Why people combine them

Stacking is an attempt to cover multiple bottlenecks at once.
If you only raise GH signaling, you may see appetite changes, water shifts, and glucose effects that require management.

If you only use a metabolic small molecule, you might not get the same body recomposition "look" that some users chase.
If you only use a lipolysis-leaning peptide fragment, you may not see meaningful changes unless training and diet are aligned.

In a best-case scenario, the stack is trying to:

- support fat mobilization and fuel switching
- preserve training performance while dieting
- reduce the odds that one pathway adaptation stalls progress

That said, stacks also increase complexity.
More moving parts means more ways to misinterpret what is happening.

## A practical dosing structure (not medical advice)

Dosing varies by formulation and by individual tolerance.
People also differ in how aggressive they want to be with calorie deficits.

A common "structure" looks like this:

| Compound | Typical timing approach | Why that timing is used |
|---|---|---|
| Tesamorelin | Evening / before bed | Aligns with the body's natural overnight GH pulse |
| 5-amino-1MQ | Morning | Pairs with daytime activity and avoids late-day stimulation for some users |
| AOD-9604 | Morning fasted or around training | Aims to pair with periods of higher fat mobilization |

If you are doing injections, make sure your technique is solid.
Read [how to inject peptides subcutaneously](/articles/how-to-inject-peptides-subcutaneously) and [reconstitution basics](/articles/how-to-reconstitute-peptides).

## What results usually look like (and what confuses people)

The first 1 to 2 weeks can be noisy.
Changes in water retention, sleep, hunger, and training output can mask real fat loss.

Weeks 3 to 6 is where most people expect clearer signals.
If diet and steps are consistent, you should be able to measure change in waist, weight trend, and gym performance.

Weeks 8 to 12 is where diminishing returns often show up.
If the stack is doing anything, it should be visible by then.
If it is not, the most likely explanation is still energy balance, not the compound.

## Diet and training considerations

Stacks work best when they are supporting a consistent plan.
Aim for adequate protein, a moderate calorie deficit, and a training routine you can repeat week after week.

If your sleep is falling apart, fix that first.
Poor sleep can flatten fat loss progress and worsen glucose control.

## Safety and monitoring (the part people skip)

This stack touches glucose, hormones, and potentially blood pressure and fluid balance.
If you are prediabetic or diabetic, you should not run a GH-axis protocol without clinician oversight.

A reasonable monitoring setup includes:

- baseline labs before starting
- mid-cycle labs at ~4 to 6 weeks
- symptom-driven checks any time something feels off

For a full lab checklist, use our [peptide bloodwork guide](/articles/peptide-bloodwork-guide).

### Markers to pay attention to

IGF-1 is the most practical marker for tesamorelin-driven GH signaling.
Fasting glucose and HbA1c help you see whether the protocol is pushing you toward insulin resistance.

If you are using GLP-1 drugs in the same season of life as this stack, be cautious with interpretation.
GLP-1s can change appetite and glucose control in ways that make "stack attribution" messy.

## Side effects and common issues

Tesamorelin and other GH-axis tools can cause water retention, tingling, and sleep changes in some users.
They can also raise fasting glucose in susceptible people.

5-amino-1MQ is often discussed as orally convenient, but oral convenience does not equal risk-free.
Any compound that shifts metabolic signaling can interact with appetite, energy, and sleep.

AOD-9604 is often described as well tolerated.
In real-world use, the bigger issues tend to be inconsistent product quality and unrealistic expectations rather than dramatic acute reactions.

## Who this stack is (and is not) for

This is most often framed as a body-recomposition approach for people already training consistently.
If training, sleep, and protein intake are not in place, a stack is usually a distraction.

Avoid or get medical oversight if you have:

- uncontrolled diabetes or recurrent hypoglycemia
- active cancer or a history where IGF-1 elevation is a concern
- significant kidney or liver disease
- pregnancy or breastfeeding

## Frequently asked questions

### Can you run this stack without dieting?

You can, but results are usually subtle.
Stacks don't replace energy balance, they mainly influence how the body responds to it.

### Do you need to cycle it?

Many users structure stacks in 8 to 12 week blocks with breaks.
The break is not just about tolerance, it's about re-evaluating whether the protocol is actually helping.

### What should you track weekly?

Pick boring metrics.
Body weight trend, waist measurement, steps, sleep, and a few consistent gym lifts are usually enough.

## The bottom line

The metabolic stack is a "multi-pathway" idea.
It tries to combine GH-axis signaling (tesamorelin), metabolic enzyme targeting (5-amino-1MQ), and a lipolysis-leaning peptide fragment (AOD-9604).

If you run anything like this, treat monitoring as part of the plan.
Get baseline labs, track glucose and IGF-1 trends, and be honest about whether diet and training are driving the outcome.
