# How to Store Peptides: Lyophilized and Reconstituted

Peptide stability usually comes down to three things: heat, light, and contamination.
If you control those, storage is straightforward.

This guide covers practical rules for both lyophilized (powder) peptides and reconstituted (liquid) peptides.
If you need the mixing steps first, start with [how to reconstitute peptides](/articles/how-to-reconstitute-peptides).

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - Lyophilized powders are far more stable than liquids.
> - For long-term storage, a freezer around -20°C is the usual default.
> - Once reconstituted, most peptides should live in the fridge (2 to 8°C).
> - Reconstituted peptides are more likely to fail from contamination than from "chemical" degradation.
> - If anything looks off (cloudiness, particles, color change), assume it's not usable.

## Storage quick reference

| State | Best temperature | Light | Typical shelf life (rule of thumb) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lyophilized (powder, sealed) | Freezer (-20°C) | Dark | Many months to years (compound-dependent) |
| Reconstituted with bacteriostatic water | Fridge (2 to 8°C) | Dark | Often ~3 to 4 weeks (compound-dependent) |
| Reconstituted with sterile water | Fridge (2 to 8°C) | Dark | Often ~48 to 72 hours (higher contamination risk) |

These are practical ranges, not guarantees.
Different peptides and formulations degrade at different rates.

## Lyophilized vs reconstituted: what changes

Lyophilized peptides are freeze-dried powders.
Because water is removed, many common degradation pathways slow down dramatically.

Reconstituted peptides have water in the vial.
Once water is present, you add two problems at the same time: faster chemical change and microbial risk from repeated vial punctures.

If you only remember one idea, remember this.
Powder buys you time, liquid does not.

## How to store lyophilized peptides (powder)

### Temperature

A freezer around -20°C is a common long-term choice.
A refrigerator (2 to 8°C) can be acceptable for shorter storage, especially if you are going to use the vial soon.

Avoid leaving lyophilized peptides at room temperature for extended periods.
Short handling time is usually fine, but steady warmth accelerates degradation.

### Light

Many peptides are sensitive to UV and bright light.
Keeping vials in their original packaging (or an opaque container) is an easy win.

If you want a research-oriented overview of light-driven degradation mechanisms, see this general discussion of photodegradation in pharmaceuticals ([PubMed: 26055427](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26055427/)).

### Moisture

Moisture is the quiet problem for powders.
Opening vials "just to check" can expose the peptide to humidity.

A practical approach:

- Keep vials sealed until you are ready to reconstitute.
- Store powders with a desiccant pack when possible.
- Minimize how long the vial is open to air.

## How to store reconstituted peptides (liquid)

Once a peptide is reconstituted, treat it like a perishable lab reagent.
Keep it cold, keep it clean, and keep exposure time short.

### Bacteriostatic water vs sterile water

Bacteriostatic water contains a preservative (often benzyl alcohol).
That preservative reduces microbial growth risk when you puncture the vial multiple times.

Sterile water has no preservative.
It can be appropriate for single-use or specific clinical contexts, but it increases the risk of contamination if you keep drawing from the same vial.

| Factor | Bacteriostatic water | Sterile water |
|---|---|---|
| Preservative | Yes | No |
| Multi-dose use | More suitable | Higher contamination risk |
| Practical shelf life (fridge) | Often weeks | Often days |

Repeated vial access is a known contamination pathway in real-world settings.
This is one reason many people prefer bacteriostatic water for multi-dose vials ([PubMed: 22610028](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22610028/)).

### Handling rules that prevent most problems

Most failures come from sloppy handling.
The peptide didn't "mysteriously degrade" - it got contaminated.

Use these habits:

- Swab the vial stopper with an alcohol pad before every puncture.
- Use a fresh needle and syringe each time.
- Inject the diluent slowly down the vial wall during reconstitution.
- Mix gently by rolling or slow inversion.
- Put the vial back in the fridge promptly.

## Should you freeze reconstituted peptides?

Freezing a reconstituted vial is controversial because it depends on the peptide and the formulation.
Freeze-thaw cycles can cause concentration gradients, precipitation, and structural stress.

If you are not working from peptide-specific stability data, the safer default is to avoid freezing reconstituted vials.
Instead, store lyophilized powders frozen and only reconstitute what you can reasonably use.

## Signs something has gone wrong

Stop and reassess if you notice:

- Cloudiness that wasn't present before
- Visible particles or "floaters"
- Color changes
- A cracked vial, compromised stopper, or suspected contamination

If you are injecting anything, contamination is the bigger risk than potency loss.
When in doubt, discard and replace.

## Travel tips (practical)

If you travel with peptides, focus on temperature stability and breakage.
Use an insulated case and keep the vial protected from light.

For a detailed checklist, see [how to travel with peptides](/articles/how-to-travel-with-peptides).

## Labeling and organization (small habits that prevent mistakes)

When you have more than one vial, the biggest risk becomes mix-ups.
Label each vial with the peptide name, the reconstitution date, the concentration, and the solvent used.

If you are storing multiple vials in a freezer, put them in a small opaque container.
That reduces light exposure, prevents breakage, and makes it harder to leave something out on the counter.

Keep the container away from the freezer door.
Door shelves see the biggest temperature swings, and swings are harder on stability than steady cold.

## Frequently asked questions

### How long do lyophilized peptides last?

It depends on the compound and storage conditions.
As a practical rule, powders stored cold, sealed, and dry tend to last much longer than reconstituted liquids.

### Can I store peptides in a normal fridge door?

It's not ideal.
The door warms up with every open/close cycle.
A stable shelf toward the back is usually better.

### Does shaking a reconstituted peptide ruin it?

Aggressive shaking can create foaming and physical stress.
Gentle mixing is a safer habit.

### Can I store reconstituted peptides in a cooler for a few hours?

For short periods, many people use an insulated case with a cold pack.
The main goal is to avoid prolonged warmth and to protect the vial from light and breakage.

## The bottom line

Treat peptide storage like basic lab hygiene.
Keep powders cold and dry, keep reconstituted vials refrigerated, avoid light, and prioritize contamination control.

If you live in a hot climate or you have frequent power outages, think about redundancy.
A small temperature alarm in the fridge or freezer and an insulated container for short disruptions can prevent an expensive loss.

When you are unsure about stability for a specific compound, the safest default is to store it lyophilized and only reconstitute what you can use.
