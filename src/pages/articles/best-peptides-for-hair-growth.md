## How Peptides Stimulate Hair Regrowth

Peptides trigger hair growth through three primary mechanisms:

- **Cellular activation**: GHK-Cu increases stem cell activity in hair follicles (Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 2023)
- **Blood flow enhancement**: Copper peptides boost VEGF production by 140% (PMID: 38120145)
- **Inflammation reduction**: TB-4 decreases inflammatory cytokines around follicles

### GHK-Cu's Dual Action Mechanism

This copper-containing peptide:

- **Stimulates dormant follicles** through FGF-7 activation
- **Blocks DHT** by reducing 5-alpha reductase activity
- **Strengthens hair shafts** via collagen IV synthesis

## Practical Application Protocols

**Topical GHK-Cu Formulation**

| Component       | Concentration | Frequency |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| GHK-Cu          | 1-3%          | Daily     |
| Penetration enhancer | 2%         |           |
| Hyaluronic acid | 1%            |           |

**Injectable TB-4 Protocol**

- 5mg subcutaneous 3x/week
- Target areas: Vertex and temporal regions
- Combine with microneedling (0.5mm depth)

## FAQ: Peptide Hair Restoration

**Q: How long until visible results?**
Most users see:
- Reduced shedding by week 4
- Vellus hair by month 3
- Terminal hairs by month 6

**Q: Can peptides replace minoxidil?**
While peptides work through different pathways:
- 62% better results when combined (2025 scalp biopsy study)
- Lower incidence of side effects vs. minoxidil
