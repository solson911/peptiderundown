# Best Peptides for Fat Loss: The 2026 Guide

Not all fat loss peptides work the same. Some suppress appetite. Others boost metabolism. A few target stubborn fat deposits directly. Here's how the top options compare in 2026.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **Semaglutide**  -  Best for appetite suppression (15-16% weight loss)
> - **Tirzepatide**  -  Dual GLP-1/GIP action (20-22% weight loss)
> - **Retatrutide**  -  Triple agonist with liver fat benefits (24%+ weight loss)
> - **AOD-9604**  -  Targets fat breakdown without appetite effects
> - **Tesamorelin**  -  Reduces visceral fat specifically
> - **CJC-1295/Ipamorelin**  -  Growth hormone secretagogues for metabolic boost
> - **MOTS-c**  -  Mitochondrial peptide with fat oxidation benefits

## The Fat Loss Peptide Ranking

| Peptide | Mechanism | Avg Weight Loss | Best For | Side Effects |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Retatrutide** | GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon | 24.2% | Maximum weight loss | Nausea, diarrhea |
| **Tirzepatide** | GLP-1 + GIP | 22% | Balanced approach | Nausea, constipation |
| **Semaglutide** | GLP-1 | 16% | First-time users | Nausea, fatigue |
| **Tesamorelin** | GHRH analog | 5-8% visceral fat | Abdominal fat | Joint pain, water retention |
| **AOD-9604** | Modified HGH fragment | 3-5% | Spot reduction | Minimal |
| **CJC-1295/Ipamorelin** | GHRP/GHRH | 2-4% | Metabolic boost | Hunger, tingling |
| **MOTS-c** | Mitochondrial | 1-3% | Aging metabolism | Rare |

## Detailed Breakdown

### Semaglutide: The Appetite Suppressor

The original GLP-1 agonist. Works by:
- **Slowing gastric emptying**  -  food stays longer
- **Reducing hunger signals**  -  less cravings
- **Improving insulin sensitivity**  -  better glucose control

**Dosing:**
| Phase | Weeks | Dose |
|-------|-------|------|
| Start | 1-4 | 0.25 mg |
| Escalate | 5-8 | 0.5 mg |
| Maintain | 9+ | 1.0-2.4 mg |

### Tirzepatide: The Dual Agonist

Adds GIP receptor activation to GLP-1:
- **Stronger appetite suppression** than GLP-1 alone
- **Better glucose control** in diabetics
- **Higher weight loss** (22% vs 16% for semaglutide)

**Key study:** SURMOUNT-1 trial showing 22% weight loss at 72 weeks.

### Retatrutide: The Triple Threat

The newest contender adds glucagon:
- **Appetite suppression** (GLP-1)
- **Improved metabolism** (GIP)
- **Increased calorie burn** (Glucagon)

**Phase 2 results:** 24.2% weight loss at 48 weeks with 82% liver fat reduction.

### AOD-9604: The Spot Reducer

Modified HGH fragment that:
- **Targets fat breakdown** directly
- **No systemic effects** on appetite
- **Minimal side effects**

Best for stubborn areas when combined with diet.

### Tesamorelin: The Visceral Fat Specialist

Growth hormone-releasing hormone analog that:
- **Reduces abdominal fat** specifically
- **Improves lipid profiles**
- **FDA-approved** for HIV lipodystrophy

**Dosing:** 2 mg daily subcutaneous injection.

### CJC-1295/Ipamorelin: The Metabolic Stack

Growth hormone secretagogues that:
- **Increase IGF-1 levels**
- **Boost fat oxidation**
- **Preserve lean mass**

Often stacked with other peptides.

### MOTS-c: The Mitochondrial Optimizer

Novel peptide that:
- **Enhances fat burning**
- **Improves exercise capacity**
- **May slow aging**

Early but promising research.

## Peptide Stacking Strategies

| Goal | Primary Peptide | Secondary Peptide | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Maximum weight loss** | Retatrutide | Tesamorelin | Liver + visceral fat |
| **Appetite control** | Semaglutide | AOD-9604 | Systemic + spot reduction |
| **Metabolic boost** | CJC-1295/Ipamorelin | MOTS-c | Growth hormone + mitochondria |
| **Visceral fat** | Tesamorelin | Tirzepatide | Abdominal focus |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which peptide causes the most weight loss?
Retatrutide currently leads with 24% average weight loss in trials.

### Can peptides target belly fat specifically?
Tesamorelin has the strongest visceral fat reduction data.

### Do peptides work without dieting?
All work better with calorie reduction. GLP-1 peptides make dieting easier.

### How long until results appear?
Most show effects within 4-8 weeks, peaking at 6-12 months.

### Are peptides safer than weight loss drugs?
Most have better safety profiles than stimulants, but all carry risks.

### Can you build muscle while using peptides?
CJC-1295/Ipamorelin stacks may help preserve muscle during fat loss.

### Do peptides require injections?
Most do. Oral semaglutide exists but is less effective.

### What's the best peptide for beginners?
Semaglutide has the most established safety profile.

## The Bottom Line

Modern peptides offer targeted approaches to fat loss:
- **GLP-1 drugs** for appetite control
- **GHRH analogs** for visceral fat
- **Mitochondrial peptides** for metabolic boost

Retatrutide represents the next generation, but all have roles in a complete fat loss strategy.
