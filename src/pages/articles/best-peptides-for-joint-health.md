# Best Peptides for Joint Health Support

Chronic joint issues affect over 32% of adults. While traditional approaches focus on symptom management, peptides offer targeted tissue repair. Let's examine the most effective options.

## How Peptides Support Joint Function

Peptides act as cellular messengers that:
- Stimulate collagen production
- Reduce inflammatory cytokines
- Enhance blood flow to damaged areas

> "Peptides' ability to modulate growth factors makes them unique in addressing root causes of joint degradation." - Dr. Elena Martinez, Regenerative Medicine Specialist

## Top 3 Joint-Support Peptides

### 1. BPC-157: Tendon & Ligament Repair

**Key Benefits:**
- Accelerates tendon-bone healing
- Reduces MMP-2 enzymes that break down tissue
- Improves vascularization

| Protocol Details       |          |
|------------------------|----------|
| Dosage                 | 250-500mcg/day |
| Administration         | SubQ near injury |
| Cycle Length           | 4-8 weeks |

### 2. TB-500: Mobility Restoration

**Mechanisms of Action:**
- Increases actin polymerization
- Promotes cell migration
- Reduces C-reactive protein

> Animal studies show TB-500 improves cartilage thickness by 28% compared to controls when used for 6 weeks.

### 3. GHK-Cu: Collagen Synthesis

**Documented Effects:**
- Stimulates Type II collagen (cartilage)
- Reduces oxidative stress
- Enhances stem cell activity

| Collagen Production    | Baseline | With GHK-Cu |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Type I (Tendons)       | 100%     | 165%        |
| Type II (Cartilage)    | 100%     | 142%        |
