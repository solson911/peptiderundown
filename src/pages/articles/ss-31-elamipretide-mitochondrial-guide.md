# SS-31 (Elamipretide): The Mitochondrial Peptide Targeting Cellular Energy

Most peptides work on hormones, receptors, or signaling pathways outside the cell. SS-31 goes somewhere different.

It crosses the cell membrane and parks itself on the inner mitochondrial membrane, right where your cells generate energy. That makes it one of the most unusual peptides in clinical development.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **SS-31 (elamipretide)** is a synthetic tetrapeptide that targets cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane
> - **FDA-approved in 2024** under the brand name Stelanir for Barth syndrome
> - **Heart failure trials** showed mixed results but improved cardiac function in subgroups
> - **Aging research** suggests it may reverse age-related mitochondrial decline in muscle, kidney, and brain tissue
> - **Generally well-tolerated** with injection site reactions as the most common side effect

## What Is SS-31?

SS-31 is a small synthetic peptide with the sequence **D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2** (where Dmt is 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine). Its clinical name is **elamipretide**, and it was developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Synthetic tetrapeptide (4 amino acids) |
| **Molecular Weight** | ~640 Da |
| **Other Names** | Elamipretide, Bendavia, MTP-131, Stelanir |
| **Primary Target** | Cardiolipin on inner mitochondrial membrane |
| **FDA Status** | Approved for Barth syndrome (2024) |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |

Unlike most peptides that bind extracellular receptors, SS-31 is cell-permeable. It concentrates inside mitochondria at roughly **1,000 to 5,000 times** the extracellular concentration within minutes of administration.

## How SS-31 Works

The mechanism is specific and well-characterized. SS-31 doesn't just "support mitochondrial health" in some vague way. It binds a single target with measurable downstream effects.

### Cardiolipin Binding: The Core Mechanism

Cardiolipin is a phospholipid found almost exclusively on the inner mitochondrial membrane. It's essential for the function of the electron transport chain, the process that generates **~90% of your body's ATP**.

SS-31 binds directly to cardiolipin through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.

What happens when it binds:

- **Stabilizes cristae structure** - the folds of the inner membrane where energy production occurs
- **Optimizes electron transport** - improving the efficiency of complexes I, III, and IV
- **Reduces electron leak** - fewer electrons escape to form damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- **Prevents cardiolipin peroxidation** - protecting the lipid from oxidative damage that impairs its function

([Birk et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24120476/))

### Why Cardiolipin Matters

Cardiolipin isn't just another membrane component. It's structurally unique, with four fatty acid chains instead of the usual two. And it's involved in nearly every critical mitochondrial function.

| Function | Role of Cardiolipin |
|----------|-------------------|
| **ATP production** | Required for proper assembly of electron transport chain supercomplexes |
| **Apoptosis** | Anchors cytochrome c; oxidized cardiolipin releases it, triggering cell death |
| **Mitochondrial dynamics** | Involved in fission and fusion of mitochondria |
| **Protein import** | Facilitates transport of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix |
| **Membrane potential** | Maintains the proton gradient that drives ATP synthase |

When cardiolipin becomes oxidized or depleted, mitochondria start failing. This happens in aging, heart failure, neurodegenerative disease, and genetic conditions like Barth syndrome.

> **Key Finding:** Age-related decline in cardiolipin content correlates directly with reduced mitochondrial function in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle tissue ([Paradies et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20594945/)).

### Reducing Oxidative Stress (Without Being an Antioxidant)

This distinction matters. SS-31 is not a traditional antioxidant that scavenges free radicals after they form. Instead, it **prevents excess ROS from being generated in the first place** by keeping the electron transport chain running efficiently.

Think of it like fixing a leaky pipe rather than mopping up the water.

- **Reduces mitochondrial ROS production** by up to 45% in preclinical models
- **Does not affect normal ROS signaling** - important because some ROS serve as cellular signals
- **Protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury** - the damage that occurs when blood flow returns after a blockage

([Szeto, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24440382/))

## Barth Syndrome: The FDA-Approved Indication

Barth syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the **tafazzin (TAFAZZIN) gene**. This gene encodes the enzyme responsible for remodeling cardiolipin into its mature form.

Without functional tafazzin, cardiolipin accumulates in abnormal forms. The result is severe mitochondrial dysfunction, primarily affecting the heart and skeletal muscle.

### The Disease

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Prevalence** | ~1 in 300,000-400,000 live births |
| **Inheritance** | X-linked recessive (almost exclusively males) |
| **Key symptoms** | Cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, growth delay |
| **Median survival** | Previously ~5 years; now improving with cardiac management |

### TAZPOWER Trial

The pivotal trial that led to FDA approval.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Participants** | 12 patients with genetically confirmed Barth syndrome |
| **Design** | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover |
| **Duration** | 12 weeks per treatment period |
| **Dose** | 40 mg subcutaneous daily |
| **Primary endpoint** | 6-minute walk test (6MWT) |

**Results:**

| Outcome | Elamipretide | Placebo |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **6MWT improvement** | +20.6 meters | -8.6 meters |
| **Total distance walked** | Significant improvement | No change |
| **Patient-reported fatigue** | Improved | No change |

The difference between drug and placebo was **29.2 meters** on the 6-minute walk test. In a disease this severe, that's clinically meaningful.

([Thompson et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089644/))

> **Important:** The FDA granted approval in January 2024 under the brand name **Stelanir**, making elamipretide the first and only approved treatment specifically targeting the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in Barth syndrome.

## Heart Failure Research

Heart failure is, at its core, an energy crisis. The failing heart can't produce enough ATP to pump effectively. Since SS-31 targets mitochondrial energy production, it was a logical candidate.

### EMBRACE Trial (HFrEF)

The largest heart failure trial for elamipretide.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Participants** | 71 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction |
| **Design** | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled |
| **Duration** | 4 weeks |
| **Doses tested** | 4 mg, 40 mg subcutaneous daily |

**Key Results:**

| Endpoint | 4 mg | 40 mg | Placebo |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| **Left ventricular end-systolic volume** | Improved | Improved | No change |
| **Ejection fraction** | Trend toward improvement | Trend toward improvement | No change |
| **6MWT** | No significant change | No significant change | No change |

The results were mixed. Cardiac imaging showed structural improvements, but functional measures like the walk test didn't hit statistical significance.

([Butler et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31597611/))

### Why the Mixed Results?

Several factors likely contributed:

- **Short treatment duration** - 4 weeks may not be enough to reverse years of cardiac remodeling
- **Small sample size** - underpowered to detect modest but real effects
- **Patient heterogeneity** - heart failure has many subtypes with different underlying mechanisms

> **Key Finding:** Post-hoc analyses suggested elamipretide was most effective in patients with the **worst baseline mitochondrial function**, hinting that patient selection could be critical for future trials.

### Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury

A separate line of research has examined SS-31 for acute cardiac events. When a blocked artery is reopened (as in a heart attack or bypass surgery), the sudden return of oxygenated blood paradoxically causes additional damage.

Preclinical studies showed SS-31 reduced infarct size by **50-60%** when administered before reperfusion in animal models.

([Kloner et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22361324/))

Human trials for this indication have been limited, and results have not matched the dramatic preclinical findings.

## Aging and Exercise Applications

This is where SS-31 research gets particularly interesting for the longevity community. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the **hallmarks of aging**, and SS-31 directly targets it.

### Age-Related Mitochondrial Decline

As we age, several things happen to our mitochondria:

- **Cardiolipin content decreases** - reducing electron transport chain efficiency
- **ROS production increases** - creating a vicious cycle of oxidative damage
- **Mitochondrial DNA mutations accumulate** - further impairing function
- **Mitophagy slows down** - damaged mitochondria aren't cleared as efficiently

SS-31 addresses the first two problems directly.

### Preclinical Aging Data

The animal data is striking.

| Study | Model | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Siegel et al., 2013** | Aged mice (26 months) | 8 weeks of SS-31 reversed age-related decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function |
| **Campbell et al., 2019** | Aged mice | Restored cardiac diastolic function to near-young levels |
| **Sweetwyne et al., 2017** | Aged mice (24 months) | Reversed age-related changes in kidney mitochondria within 8 weeks |

([Siegel et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24209692/))

([Campbell et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30786252/))

([Sweetwyne et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27999110/))

> **Key Finding:** In aged mice, 8 weeks of SS-31 treatment was sufficient to restore skeletal muscle energetics to levels seen in young animals. This was not just slowing decline. It was reversal.

### Exercise Performance

A small but growing body of research examines SS-31's effects on exercise capacity.

In aged animals, SS-31 improved exercise tolerance, likely through enhanced mitochondrial ATP production in skeletal muscle. The peptide also reduced exercise-induced oxidative damage.

For human athletes and fitness enthusiasts, the implications are speculative but intriguing. Better mitochondrial function could mean:

- **Improved aerobic capacity** through more efficient oxidative phosphorylation
- **Faster recovery** from reduced exercise-induced mitochondrial damage
- **Greater fatigue resistance** in endurance activities

No controlled human trials have examined SS-31 specifically for exercise performance in healthy individuals.

## Dosing

> **Important:** These are research-based protocols, not medical prescriptions. The only approved dosing is for Barth syndrome under medical supervision. Always work with a qualified provider.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Approved dose (Barth syndrome)** | 40 mg subcutaneous daily |
| **Research doses (heart failure)** | 4 mg or 40 mg subcutaneous daily |
| **Research doses (other)** | 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg in various trials |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Half-life** | Approximately 3-4 hours |
| **Frequency** | Once daily in most protocols |

### Reconstitution

SS-31 from research suppliers typically comes as a lyophilized powder. Standard reconstitution with bacteriostatic water applies. See our [reconstitution guide](/articles/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) for step-by-step instructions.

### Practical Notes

The short half-life of SS-31 is worth noting. Unlike peptides such as BPC-157 or semaglutide that are dosed less frequently, SS-31 appears to require daily administration for sustained mitochondrial effects.

Some research protocols have used twice-daily dosing to maintain more consistent tissue concentrations.

## Side Effects

SS-31 has a generally favorable safety profile based on clinical trial data across multiple indications.

### Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Injection site reactions** | Very common (~30%) | Redness, pain, itching at injection site |
| **Headache** | Common | Usually mild and transient |
| **Fatigue** | Occasional | Paradoxical given the mechanism; typically resolves |
| **Nausea** | Occasional | Less common than with GLP-1 peptides |

### Less Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Dizziness** | Uncommon | More reported at higher doses |
| **Skin reactions** | Uncommon | Rash or urticaria in some patients |
| **Contact urticaria** | Rare | Reported in Barth syndrome trials |

### When to Stop

- **Severe injection site reactions** - spreading redness, swelling, or signs of infection
- **Allergic reactions** - difficulty breathing, facial swelling, widespread hives
- **Persistent worsening of symptoms** - consult your provider immediately

## SS-31 vs. MOTS-c: Two Approaches to Mitochondrial Health

Both SS-31 and MOTS-c are called "mitochondrial peptides," but they work through completely different mechanisms.

| Feature | SS-31 (Elamipretide) | MOTS-c |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| **Origin** | Synthetic (lab-designed) | Endogenous (encoded by mitochondrial DNA) |
| **Target** | Cardiolipin on inner mitochondrial membrane | AMPK pathway and nuclear gene regulation |
| **Mechanism** | Stabilizes electron transport chain | Activates cellular energy sensor, improves glucose uptake |
| **Primary effects** | Restores mitochondrial structure and ATP production | Metabolic regulation, exercise mimetic, insulin sensitivity |
| **Clinical trials** | Multiple phase 2/3 trials, one FDA approval | Very early clinical development |
| **FDA status** | Approved for Barth syndrome | Not approved |
| **Best studied for** | Heart failure, genetic mitochondrial disease | Metabolic syndrome, obesity, exercise performance |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Half-life** | ~3-4 hours | Not well characterized in humans |

> **Bottom line:** SS-31 works from the inside out, physically stabilizing the machinery that makes ATP. MOTS-c works from the outside in, activating signaling pathways that tell cells to ramp up energy metabolism. They're complementary rather than competing approaches.

The choice between them depends on the problem. For structural mitochondrial damage (aging, genetic disease, ischemia), SS-31 has stronger evidence. For metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance, MOTS-c may be more relevant.

## Who Might Benefit

Based on current research:

- **Barth syndrome patients** - the only FDA-approved indication; demonstrated clinical benefit
- **People with mitochondrial myopathies** - conditions where impaired mitochondrial function drives muscle weakness
- **Heart failure patients** - particularly those with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary driver
- **Aging adults with declining energy** - speculative but supported by strong preclinical data showing reversal of age-related mitochondrial changes
- **Those interested in longevity** - as a targeted intervention for one of the core hallmarks of aging

> **Important:** Outside of Barth syndrome, all applications are investigational. Clinical evidence in healthy aging adults does not yet exist.

## Legal Status and Availability

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **United States** | FDA-approved for Barth syndrome (Stelanir); investigational for all other uses |
| **European Union** | Not approved; orphan drug designation granted |
| **Australia** | Not approved; available through special access schemes |
| **Research use** | Available from peptide research suppliers |

The approval for Barth syndrome does not make SS-31 legally available for off-label use without a prescription. Research-grade SS-31 is available from peptide suppliers, but quality and purity vary.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does SS-31 actually do?

SS-31 binds to cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing the electron transport chain. This improves ATP production, reduces excessive reactive oxygen species, and protects mitochondria from oxidative damage. The net effect is better cellular energy production.

### How quickly does SS-31 work?

SS-31 concentrates in mitochondria within minutes of injection. Measurable improvements in mitochondrial function have been observed within hours in preclinical models.

But clinical benefits take longer. In the Barth syndrome trial, improvements in exercise capacity were measured over 12 weeks. For age-related decline, animal studies suggest 4 to 8 weeks of daily treatment to see meaningful changes.

### Is SS-31 the same as elamipretide?

Yes. SS-31 is the research name, elamipretide is the clinical/pharmaceutical name, and Stelanir is the brand name. Bendavia and MTP-131 are older names for the same compound.

### Can SS-31 reverse aging?

That's a strong claim, and the honest answer is: we don't know yet in humans. In aged mice, SS-31 reversed mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidneys. Whether that translates to measurable anti-aging effects in people remains to be proven.

What it can do is target one specific hallmark of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction. It won't make you younger, but it may help your mitochondria function more like they did when you were younger.

### Can I combine SS-31 with other peptides?

No clinical trials have examined SS-31 in combination with other peptides. Theoretically, combining it with MOTS-c could provide complementary mitochondrial support through different mechanisms. Some in the research community also combine it with NAD+ precursors like NMN or NR, though evidence for synergy is limited to speculation.

Always discuss combinations with a qualified provider.

### How is SS-31 different from CoQ10 or other mitochondrial supplements?

CoQ10 is a component of the electron transport chain and works as an electron carrier. SS-31 doesn't carry electrons. It stabilizes the structural environment where electron transport happens.

Think of CoQ10 as adding oil to an engine. SS-31 is more like reinforcing the engine block itself. They work at different levels of the problem.

Also, oral CoQ10 has poor bioavailability and limited ability to reach mitochondria. SS-31 concentrates in mitochondria at thousandfold higher levels than plasma, making it far more targeted.

### What's the cost of SS-31?

Stelanir (the approved Barth syndrome treatment) is priced as an orphan drug, meaning very expensive, likely in the range of tens of thousands of dollars annually. Research-grade SS-31 from peptide suppliers varies widely but is generally in the range of **$50 to $150 per vial** depending on quantity and supplier.

## The Bottom Line

SS-31 is one of the most precisely targeted peptides in existence. Rather than working through hormone receptors or broad signaling pathways, it goes directly to the inner mitochondrial membrane and stabilizes the machinery that produces cellular energy.

The FDA approval for Barth syndrome validated the mechanism. The heart failure data, while mixed, showed biological activity in the right direction. And the preclinical aging data is some of the most compelling evidence for any single intervention targeting mitochondrial decline.

The big question is whether the striking animal results will translate to meaningful benefits in aging humans. That data doesn't exist yet. But for a peptide that targets one of the most fundamental processes in cellular biology, SS-31 is worth watching closely.
