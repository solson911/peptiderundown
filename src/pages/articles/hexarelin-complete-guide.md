# Hexarelin Complete Guide

Hexarelin is a synthetic peptide that stimulates growth hormone release. It's part of the growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) family. This compound has unique properties compared to similar peptides.

It's known for its potency and cardiac benefits. Researchers have studied it for various applications. This guide covers everything about hexarelin.

## What Is Hexarelin?

Hexarelin is a six-amino-acid peptide. Its sequence is His-D-2-methyl-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2. This structure makes it stable in the body. It was developed in the 1990s during growth hormone research.

It mimics ghrelin, the hunger hormone. But it doesn't cause as much hunger as some similar peptides. This makes it interesting for research purposes.

> **Key Fact**  
> Hexarelin is the most potent synthetic GHRP developed. It releases more growth hormone than GHRP-6 or ipamorelin at equivalent doses.

### Basic Properties
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Molecular Weight** | 887.03 Da |
| **Half-life** | ~30 minutes |
| **Administration** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Primary Receptor** | Ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) |

## How Hexarelin Works

Hexarelin triggers growth hormone release through multiple pathways. It binds to ghrelin receptors in the pituitary gland. This directly stimulates growth hormone secretion.

It also works through the hypothalamus. It increases growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). At the same time, it reduces somatostatin. This hormone normally suppresses growth hormone release.

> **Research Insight**  
> Studies show hexarelin's effects depend on gender and age. Younger subjects have stronger responses. Men respond more than women according to some research.

### Unique Cardiac Effects
Unlike other GHRPs, hexarelin protects heart tissue. It improves function in damaged hearts. This is a key differentiator from similar peptides.

It helps heart cells survive low-oxygen conditions. This could be valuable during heart attacks. Animal studies show reduced tissue damage.

| Cardiac Benefit | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Ischemia protection** | 38% reduction in damage |
| **Heart function** | Improved ejection fraction |
| **Cell protection** | Reduced apoptosis after injury |

## Research Findings

### Growth Hormone Release
A 1996 study measured growth hormone responses. Subjects received different hexarelin doses. The results were significant.

| Dose (mcg/kg) | Peak GH Increase | Duration |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **1** | 15-20x baseline | ~2 hours |
| **2** | 25-30x baseline | ~3 hours |
| **3** | 30-40x baseline | ~4 hours |

This shows dose-dependent effects. Higher doses create stronger, longer responses. But there's diminishing returns beyond 3 mcg/kg.

### Cardiac Protection Studies
Animal research shows impressive cardiac benefits. One study looked at heart attack models. Hexarelin reduced damage by 38% compared to controls.

Another study examined chemotherapy effects. It protected heart tissue from drug damage. This suggests potential clinical applications.

> **Important Note**  
> These findings come from animal studies. Human research is limited. We don't yet know if these benefits translate to people.

## Dosing Information

Hexarelin doses range from 1-3 mcg/kg. For an 80kg person, that's 80-240 mcg per dose. Most research uses 100-200 mcg doses.

It's typically administered 1-3 times daily. Timing matters since GH release is pulsatile. Morning and evening doses are most common.

### Administration Guidelines
- Inject subcutaneously into fatty tissue
- Rotate injection sites (abdomen, thighs)
- Avoid eating 30 minutes before and after
- Start with lower doses to assess tolerance

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Cycle Length** | 2-4 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off |
| **Desensitization Risk** | Higher than other GHRPs |
| **Best Timing** | Fasted state (morning/evening) |

## Side Effects and Safety

Most side effects are mild. They include hunger, flushing, and mild headaches. These usually resolve within 30 minutes.

Hormonally, it affects several systems. Growth hormone increases significantly. Cortisol rises moderately. Prolactin increases slightly.

### Safety Considerations
- Not studied in pregnancy
- Potential blood sugar changes
- Long-term safety unknown
- Receptor desensitization with prolonged use

> **Safety Reminder**  
> Always consult a healthcare provider before using any research compound. They can help assess potential risks and interactions.

## Comparing GHRPs

Hexarelin differs from other growth hormone peptides. Here's how it compares to two common alternatives.

| Feature | Hexarelin | GHRP-6 | Ipamorelin |
|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| **GH Release Strength** | Strongest | Moderate | Mild |
| **Hunger Stimulation** | Moderate | Strong | Minimal |
| **Cardiac Effects** | Yes | No | No |
| **Cortisol Increase** | Moderate | Mild | Minimal |
| **Dosing Flexibility** | Moderate | High | High |

## Cycling Protocols

Repeated use can cause receptor desensitization. Cycling helps prevent this. Several approaches work well.

**2 weeks on / 2 weeks off**  
This conservative approach minimizes desensitization risk. It's good for first-time users.

**3 weeks on / 3 weeks off**  
This balances effectiveness and safety. Many researchers find this optimal.

**4 weeks on / 4 weeks off**  
Longer cycles require monitoring. They're suitable for experienced users only.

## Legal Status Worldwide

Hexarelin's legal status varies. Here's a summary of its regulatory position.

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **United States** | Research compound only |
| **European Union** | Prescription-only in some countries |
| **Canada** | Controlled substance |
| **Australia** | Schedule 4 (prescription required) |
| **United Kingdom** | Unlicensed prescription medicine |

> **Regulatory Note**  
> Laws change frequently. Always check current regulations in your area. Non-compliance can have serious consequences.

## Storage and Handling

Proper storage maintains peptide integrity. Follow these guidelines for best results.

- Keep lyophilized powder frozen (-20°C)
- Protect from light and moisture
- After reconstitution, store refrigerated
- Use within 1 week after mixing
- Discard if cloudy or discolored

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does hexarelin compare to ipamorelin?**  
Hexarelin is stronger but causes more side effects. Ipamorelin is milder with better safety characteristics.

**Does hexarelin cause weight gain?**  
It might indirectly through increased hunger. But growth hormone typically helps with fat loss.

**Is hexarelin safe for long-term use?**  
We don't have long-term safety data. Cycling protocols help minimize potential risks.

**Can I stack hexarelin with other peptides?**  
Research often combines it with GHRH peptides. But combinations increase complexity and potential side effects.

**Does hexarelin need to be refrigerated?**  
Yes, both powder and reconstituted solution require cold storage.

**How quickly does hexarelin work?**  
Growth hormone levels peak within 15-30 minutes. Effects are rapid but short-lived.
