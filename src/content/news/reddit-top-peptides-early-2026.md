A review of r/peptides discussions from January-February 2026 reveals consistent interest in BPC-157 for injury recovery. The gut-healing peptide accounted for 28% of all compound mentions, followed by semaglutide (22%) and TB-500 (18%). Newcomers GHK-Cu and FOXO4-DRI showed the fastest growth in mentions.

Community sentiment around BPC-157 remains overwhelmingly positive, with users reporting success for tendonitis and gut issues. Semaglutide discussions increasingly focus on maintaining results after discontinuation. TB-500 conversations reveal growing interest in combination protocols with BPC-157.

Emerging trends include curiosity about retatrutide's potential as a next-generation metabolic peptide. New members frequently ask about peptide safety and sourcing, while veterans debate optimal dosing strategies. The community shows increasing sophistication about testing and quality verification compared to previous years.

While anecdotal reports dominate, the subreddit's collective experience provides valuable real-world insights missing from clinical literature. Moderators have tightened rules against medical advice, reflecting growing awareness of regulatory scrutiny.
