The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) announced stricter enforcement measures for peptide imports starting February 2026. The new rules target personal importation schemes that previously allowed Australians to order small quantities of peptides for research purposes.

Under the updated regulations, all peptide imports now require a formal declaration specifying intended use. Quantities over 3 months' personal supply will be automatically flagged for inspection. The TGA also expanded its list of prohibited peptides to include several growth hormone secretagogues previously available through research channels.

These changes come after a 2025 review found increasing diversion of research peptides into clinical and performance enhancement use. While the TGA maintains that legitimate research use remains permitted, the burden of proof now falls on importers to demonstrate compliance.

Australian peptide users should expect delays at customs as the new system rolls out. Those ordering from overseas suppliers may need to provide additional documentation proving research intent. Domestic peptide research suppliers report increased demand as users shift to local sources.
