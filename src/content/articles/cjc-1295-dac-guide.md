# CJC-1295 with DAC: Long-Acting Growth Hormone Releaser

If you've spent any time looking into growth hormone peptides, you've probably run into CJC-1295. But there's a catch that trips people up: there are **two versions**.

CJC-1295 with DAC and CJC-1295 without DAC (sometimes called "mod GRF 1-29") are related compounds with very different behavior in the body. This guide is about the DAC version, the one that sticks around for days instead of minutes.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - CJC-1295 DAC binds to albumin, extending its half-life to **6-8 days** (vs. 30 minutes for the no-DAC version)
> - It amplifies natural GH pulses and raises IGF-1 by **36-105%**, with only twice-weekly injections needed
> - Benefits include fat loss (especially visceral), better sleep, improved recovery, and skin/connective tissue support
> - Water retention and tingling are the most common side effects; monitor IGF-1 and blood glucose with periodic labs

## What Is CJC-1295 DAC?

CJC-1295 is a synthetic analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Your hypothalamus naturally produces GHRH, which tells the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH).

The problem with natural GHRH is that it gets chewed up by enzymes in minutes. Researchers at ConjuChem Biotechnologies solved this by modifying the first 29 amino acids of GHRH and attaching a **Drug Affinity Complex (DAC)**.

This is a reactive chemical group that binds to **albumin**, the most abundant protein in your blood.

## How the Drug Affinity Complex Extends Half-Life

Once CJC-1295 DAC is injected, the DAC moiety forms a covalent bond with circulating albumin. Albumin has a half-life of roughly **19-21 days** in humans.

By hitching a ride on albumin, CJC-1295 DAC extends its own half-life from about 30 minutes (for the non-DAC version) to approximately **5.8-8 days** ([Teichman et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16352683/)).

This means a single injection can elevate GH levels for nearly a week. The albumin binding also protects the peptide from enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV).

## How CJC-1295 DAC Stimulates Growth Hormone

CJC-1295 DAC works through the GHRH receptor (GHRHR) on somatotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. When it binds this receptor, it triggers a signaling cascade that leads to GH synthesis and secretion.

> **Key Distinction:** Unlike exogenous GH injections that flatten natural pulsatility, CJC-1295 DAC works *with* your body's existing GH rhythm.

Key points about how it works:

- **Amplifies natural pulses** — increases both the amplitude and frequency of GH pulses while maintaining pulsatile pattern ([Ionescu & Bhatt, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713752/))
- **Raises IGF-1** — the Teichman study found IGF-1 levels increased by **36-105%** after single doses, with effects lasting up to 28 days
- **Negative feedback still works** — somatostatin still functions, providing a safety buffer you don't get with direct GH injection

## Benefits: What CJC-1295 DAC Actually Does

Most benefits come from sustained elevation of GH and IGF-1.

### Fat Loss

GH is one of the most potent lipolytic hormones in your body:

- **Promotes breakdown of stored triglycerides** — increases fatty acid oxidation
- **Reduces visceral fat** — consistently shown in GH-deficient adults ([Johannsson et al., 1997](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9024231/))
- **Sustained elevation helps** — fat loss from GH requires consistent elevation over weeks to months

The long **5.8-8 day half-life** makes CJC-1295 DAC particularly well-suited for this purpose.

### Muscle Growth and Recovery

GH and IGF-1 promote protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. They don't build muscle the way testosterone does, but they create an anabolic environment that supports lean tissue growth with resistance training.

Recovery is where many users report the most noticeable difference. GH plays a direct role in collagen synthesis and connective tissue repair ([Doessing et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20427735/)).

### Sleep Quality

GH secretion naturally peaks during deep sleep. GH-releasing peptides have been shown to increase slow-wave sleep duration ([Frieboes et al., 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7768645/)).

Users frequently report improved sleep depth and feeling more rested.

### Skin and Connective Tissue

GH stimulates collagen production. Users often notice improved skin elasticity and thickness, usually after 2-3 months of consistent use. Hair and nail growth may also improve.

### General Recovery and Healing

From joint repair to wound healing, GH accelerates tissue repair processes. This is well-documented in clinical settings ([Herndon et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15273542/)).

## CJC-1295 DAC vs. No-DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)

| Feature | CJC-1295 DAC | CJC-1295 No-DAC (Mod GRF 1-29) |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Half-life** | 5.8-8 days | ~30 minutes |
| **Dosing frequency** | 2x per week | 2-3x per day |
| **GH release pattern** | Sustained elevation (GH "bleed") | Sharp pulse, then returns to baseline |
| **Convenience** | High | Low |
| **GH pulsatility** | Somewhat blunted between doses | Mimics natural pulse closely |
| **Best for** | Steady IGF-1 elevation, convenience | Natural-style GH pulses |

The no-DAC version is often preferred by people who want to preserve the most natural GH pulsatility possible. CJC-1295 DAC keeps stimulating GH release continuously.

Some researchers have raised concern about partial desensitization of somatotroph cells over time, though clinical data hasn't shown this to be a major issue.

## CJC-1295 DAC vs. Ipamorelin

These two get compared constantly because they're often used together. But they work through completely different mechanisms.

- **CJC-1295 DAC** — GHRH analog, acts on the GHRH receptor
- **Ipamorelin** — growth hormone secretagogue (GHS), acts on the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a)

They stimulate GH release through separate pathways, producing a synergistic effect when combined. For a full breakdown, see our [tesamorelin and ipamorelin stack guide](/articles/tesamorelin-ipamorelin-stack-guide).

Unlike GHRP-6 or GHRP-2, ipamorelin doesn't significantly raise cortisol or prolactin at normal doses ([Raun et al., 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9849822/)). This makes the CJC-1295 DAC + ipamorelin combination popular: sustained baseline GH elevation plus acute pulses, without hunger or cortisol spikes.

## How to Dose CJC-1295 DAC

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Standard dose** | 1-2 mg subcutaneous, twice per week |
| **Injection timing** | Evening preferred; consistent schedule |
| **Cycle length** | 8-16 weeks on, 4-8 weeks off |
| **With ipamorelin** | CJC-1295 DAC 2 mg 2x/week + ipamorelin 200-300 mcg 1-3x daily |

**Reconstitution:** CJC-1295 DAC typically comes as lyophilized powder. Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water. Store reconstituted peptide refrigerated and use within 3-4 weeks. See our [peptide storage guide](/articles/how-to-store-peptides) for details.

## Side Effects

CJC-1295 DAC is generally well-tolerated in studies. Most side effects relate to GH elevation itself.

### Common Side Effects

- **Water retention** — puffy hands, swollen ankles, general bloating; dose-dependent
- **Numbness and tingling** — carpal tunnel-like symptoms from elevated GH/IGF-1; signal to lower dose if persistent
- **Injection site reactions** — redness, swelling, itching; usually mild and temporary
- **Headaches** — some users report these, particularly in the first week or two

### Less Common Concerns

- **Cortisol and prolactin** — GHRH analogs can cause modest increases; less of a concern with ipamorelin pairing
- **Blood sugar effects** — GH is a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin; people with insulin resistance should monitor glucose
- **Joint pain** — initial water retention can cause joint discomfort

### Serious Risks

Long-term effects of sustained GH elevation are a legitimate concern. Chronically high IGF-1 levels have been associated with increased cancer risk in epidemiological studies ([Renehan et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15026468/)). However, GH levels from CJC-1295 DAC are typically within or slightly above physiological range.

> **Important:** Anyone with a history of cancer or active malignancy should avoid GH-stimulating peptides. For a broader look at risks, see our [peptide side effects guide](/articles/peptide-side-effects-what-to-know).

## Practical Tips

- **Fasting and food timing** — elevated blood sugar and insulin blunt GH release; some users inject on an empty stomach or before bed
- **Lab monitoring** — track IGF-1 levels, fasting glucose, and HbA1c periodically; IGF-1 gives an objective measure of whether the peptide is working
- **Storage** — keep lyophilized peptide frozen or refrigerated; once reconstituted, refrigerate and don't freeze; gently swirl, never shake

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How fast does CJC-1295 DAC start working?

GH and IGF-1 levels begin rising within hours of the first injection. Noticeable benefits like improved sleep and recovery typically take 2-4 weeks. Full effects on fat loss and muscle develop over 2-3 months.

### Can I use CJC-1295 DAC without combining it with anything?

Yes. It works on its own. But most protocols combine it with a GHS like ipamorelin for synergistic effects. Think of GHRH as the gas pedal and GHS as a turbo boost.

### Does CJC-1295 DAC suppress natural GH production?

Not in the same way exogenous GH does. CJC-1295 DAC works through the GHRH receptor, still using your pituitary to make GH. Somatostatin feedback remains intact.

When you stop, your pituitary continues functioning normally. There's no "shutdown" analogous to anabolic steroids.

### Is CJC-1295 DAC legal?

CJC-1295 DAC is sold as a research chemical in many countries. It's not approved by the FDA for human use. It's banned by WADA and most sports organizations.

### How do I know if my CJC-1295 DAC is real?

Test your IGF-1 before and 2-3 weeks after starting. Genuine CJC-1295 DAC should produce a measurable increase. Third-party testing services can also verify peptide identity and purity.

### What's the difference between CJC-1295 DAC and sermorelin?

Both are GHRH analogs, but sermorelin is the original with a very short half-life (about 10-20 minutes). It was FDA-approved for GH deficiency in children before being discontinued for commercial reasons.

CJC-1295 DAC is a more potent, longer-lasting successor. Sermorelin requires daily injections; CJC-1295 DAC needs only twice weekly.

## The Bottom Line

CJC-1295 DAC is one of the most practical GH-releasing peptides available. Its long half-life means fewer injections, more stable GH output, and better compliance compared to short-acting alternatives. The trade-off is less precise control over GH pulsatility.

It's not a magic bullet. The benefits are real but gradual, and they work best alongside solid training, nutrition, and sleep habits.

Start with a low dose, monitor your labs, and pay attention to how your body responds. Work with a knowledgeable healthcare provider who understands peptide therapy.
