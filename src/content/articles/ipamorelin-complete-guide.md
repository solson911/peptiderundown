# Ipamorelin: The Selective Growth Hormone Secretagogue

Growth hormone peptides come with risks. Water retention. Joint pain. Blood sugar spikes. 

Ipamorelin changes that. 

As the first **selective ghrelin receptor agonist**, it boosts growth hormone (GH) without the side effects of older peptides. The research shows why it's become a favorite for anti-aging and recovery.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **First selective GHS-R agonist**  -  targets growth hormone release without affecting cortisol or prolactin
> - **5-7x GH increase**  -  comparable to GHRP-6 but with better safety
> - **No hunger spikes**  -  unlike other ghrelin agonists
> - **Minimal side effects**  -  no water retention or joint pain at clinical doses
> - **Synergistic with CJC-1295**  -  often stacked for amplified effects

## What Is Ipamorelin?

Ipamorelin is a **pentapeptide** (five amino acids) that mimics ghrelin, the "hunger hormone." 

Unlike older growth hormone secretagogues, it selectively activates only the GH release pathway.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Synthetic pentapeptide |
| **Molecular Weight** | ~711.8 Da |
| **Sequence** | Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 |
| **Primary Research** | Clinical (human trials) |
| **FDA Status** | Not approved |

Developed in the 1990s, ipamorelin was designed to avoid the drawbacks of earlier peptides like GHRP-6.

## How Ipamorelin Works

### Ghrelin Receptor Activation
Ipamorelin binds to the **growth hormone secretagogue receptor** (GHS-R1a) in the pituitary and hypothalamus:

- **Stimulates GH release**  -  mimics natural ghrelin signaling
> **Key Finding:** In clinical trials, ipamorelin increased GH by 5-7x baseline without affecting other hormones.

## Clinical Research

### Growth Hormone Effects
A 2001 study measured GH levels after ipamorelin administration:

| Time Post-Injection | GH Increase |
|---------------------|-------------|
| 30 min | 3.2x baseline |
| 60 min | 6.8x baseline |
| 90 min | 5.1x baseline |

([Chapman et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11739391/))

## Dosing Protocol

> **Important:** These are research protocols, not medical advice.

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Dose range** | 200-500 mcg |
| **Frequency** | 1-3x daily |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Cycle length** | 8-12 weeks |
| **Best timing** | Fasted (morning/evening) |

### Stacking with CJC-1295
Many combine ipamorelin with **CJC-1295** (a GHRH analog):

- **CJC-1295** extends GH pulse duration
- **Ipamorelin** increases pulse amplitude
- **Synergistic effect** greater than either alone

See our [CJC-1295 guide](/articles/cjc-1295-dac-guide) for details.

## Side Effects

### Common
| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Flushing** | Occasional | Mild, temporary |
| **Tingling** | Rare | Hands/feet |
| **Headache** | Rare | First few doses |

## Ipamorelin vs Other GHRPs

| Feature | Ipamorelin | GHRP-6 | GHRP-2 |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **GH Increase** | 5-7x | 7-10x | 6-9x |
| **Hunger Stimulation** | None | Strong | Moderate |
| **Cortisol Effect** | None | Increases | Slight increase |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I see results?
Most notice:
- **Sleep quality** improves in 1-2 weeks
- **Recovery** accelerates by week 3-4

### Can I take ipamorelin orally?
No. It's destroyed in the gut. Must be injected.

## The Bottom Line

Ipamorelin offers a **safer alternative** to traditional growth hormone peptides. Its selective action provides GH benefits without cortisol spikes or hunger pangs.
