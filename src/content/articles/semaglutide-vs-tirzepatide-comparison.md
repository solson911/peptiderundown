# Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide: The Ultimate Comparison

The obesity treatment landscape changed forever with the arrival of GLP-1 receptor agonists. First came semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy). Then tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) raised the bar. But how do these two titans compare? This guide breaks down everything from mechanisms to real-world results.

> **Key Takeaways**
> - **Semaglutide** targets only GLP-1 receptors; **tirzepatide** hits both GLP-1 and GIP
> - Tirzepatide produces **greater weight loss** (~22.5% vs ~15% for semaglutide)
> - Both require **once-weekly injections** with gradual dose escalation
> - GI side effects are common with both but may be slightly less severe with tirzepatide
> - Semaglutide has **proven cardiovascular benefits**; tirzepatide's CVOT is ongoing
> - Cost is similar (~$1,000/month); insurance coverage remains inconsistent

## Mechanism Comparison

| Mechanism | Semaglutide | Tirzepatide |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **GLP-1 receptor agonism** | Strong | Strong |
| **GIP receptor agonism** | None | Strong |
| **Appetite suppression** | Yes | Yes (stronger) |
| **Gastric emptying** | Slows significantly | Slows moderately |
| **Insulin secretion** | Glucose-dependent | Glucose-dependent |
| **Glucagon suppression** | Yes | Yes |
| **Energy expenditure** | Minimal effect | Potentially increased via GIP |

### Why GIP Matters

GLP-1 does most of the heavy lifting for weight loss, but GIP adds:
- Enhanced insulin sensitivity
- Complementary appetite regulation in the brain
- Direct effects on fat tissue metabolism

([Samms et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866435/))

> **Key Finding:** The dual agonism of tirzepatide appears to produce additive effects beyond GLP-1 alone.

## Weight Loss Results

### Clinical Trial Data

| Trial | Semaglutide 2.4 mg | Tirzepatide 15 mg |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Study** | STEP 1 | SURMOUNT-1 |
| **Duration** | 68 weeks | 72 weeks |
| **Participants** | Non-diabetic obese/overweight | Non-diabetic obese/overweight |
| **Average weight loss** | ~15% | ~22.5% |
| **≥10% weight loss** | 69.1% | 85.5% |
| **≥15% weight loss** | 50.5% | 67.5% |
| **≥20% weight loss** | 32.0% | 50.7% |

([Wilding et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33567185/); [Jastreboff et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35658024/))

### Head-to-Head: SURPASS-2

The only direct comparison trial used diabetes doses (semaglutide 1 mg vs tirzepatide 5/10/15 mg):

| Metric | Semaglutide 1 mg | Tirzepatide 5 mg | Tirzepatide 10 mg | Tirzepatide 15 mg |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **HbA1c reduction** | 1.86% | 2.01% | 2.24% | 2.30% |
| **Weight loss** | 5.7 kg | 7.6 kg | 9.3 kg | 11.2 kg |

([Frias et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34170647/))

> **Bottom line:** Tirzepatide produces significantly greater weight loss than semaglutide at all comparable doses.

## Side Effect Comparison

| Side Effect | Semaglutide 2.4 mg | Tirzepatide 15 mg |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Nausea** | 44% | 31% |
| **Diarrhea** | 30% | 23% |
| **Vomiting** | 24% | 12% |
| **Constipation** | 24% | 17% |
| **Discontinuation due to AEs** | 7% | 6.2% |

Tirzepatide may be slightly better tolerated, especially at higher doses.

## Dosing Comparison

| Parameter | Semaglutide (Wegovy) | Tirzepatide (Zepbound) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Starting dose** | 0.25 mg | 2.5 mg |
| **Maintenance dose** | 2.4 mg | 5/10/15 mg |
| **Titration duration** | 16 weeks | 20 weeks |
| **Injection frequency** | Weekly | Weekly |
| **Oral option** | Rybelsus (less effective) | None |

## Cost and Availability

| Feature | Semaglutide | Tirzepatide |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Brand names** | Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus | Mounjaro, Zepbound |
| **List price** | ~$1,300/month | ~$1,060/month |
| **Insurance coverage** | Varies; better for diabetes | Varies; better for diabetes |
| **FDA approval (obesity)** | 2021 | 2023 |
| **Compounded availability** | Limited/contested | Limited/contested |

## Which Should You Choose?

Consider **semaglutide** if:
- You want the longest safety track record
- Proven cardiovascular benefit is important (SELECT trial)
- You prefer an oral option (Rybelsus)
- Insurance covers it better

Consider **tirzepatide** if:
- Maximum weight loss is the priority
- You haven't responded adequately to semaglutide
- You tolerate the side effects better
- Insurance covers it

> **Important:** Always discuss medication choices with your healthcare provider. Individual responses vary.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you switch from semaglutide to tirzepatide?
Yes. Many providers recommend a 2-4 week washout period when switching between GLP-1 drugs to assess tolerance.

### Which works faster?
Both take several weeks to reach full effect. Head-to-head data suggests tirzepatide may produce slightly faster initial weight loss.

### Is tirzepatide safer than semaglutide?
Both have similar safety profiles. Semaglutide has longer real-world experience. Tirzepatide's cardiovascular outcomes trial (SURPASS-CVOT) is ongoing.

### Can you take both together?
No. Combining GLP-1 agonists is not recommended and could be dangerous.

### Which is better for diabetes?
Tirzepatide showed superior HbA1c reductions in SURPASS-2, but both are effective. Choice depends on individual factors.

## The Bottom Line

Tirzepatide's dual agonism produces greater weight loss than semaglutide in clinical trials. But semaglutide has a longer track record and proven cardiovascular benefits. Cost and access issues affect both. The "better" drug depends on your individual priorities, response, and insurance coverage.
