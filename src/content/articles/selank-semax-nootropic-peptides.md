# Selank and Semax: Russian Nootropic Peptides Explained

Russia has a long and somewhat underappreciated history of peptide research. While Western pharmaceutical development focused heavily on small molecules and later biologics, Russian scientists were quietly building an impressive body of work on synthetic peptides for cognitive enhancement and immune modulation.

Two peptides that came out of this tradition stand out: Selank and Semax. Both were developed at the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and both have been approved as prescription medications in Russia. In the West, they've built a dedicated following among nootropic enthusiasts and biohackers.

But there's more to these peptides than internet hype. Let's look at what the research actually tells us.

> **Key Takeaways**
> - Selank is an anxiolytic peptide based on the immune peptide tuftsin; it modulates GABA and serotonin without sedation or addiction
> - Semax is a cognitive enhancer derived from ACTH that upregulates BDNF and NGF for neuroprotection and focus
> - Both are administered as nasal sprays and are approved prescription medications in Russia
> - They can be stacked together for "calm focus," with Selank reducing anxiety and Semax sharpening cognition

## Origins: From Soviet Research Labs to Modern Nootropics

The development of both Selank and Semax traces back to Soviet-era research programs aimed at enhancing cognitive performance and stress resilience. The work was led by Nikolai Myasoedov and his colleagues at the Russian Academy of Sciences, starting in the 1980s and continuing through the post-Soviet period.

The approach was clever. Rather than designing entirely novel molecules, the researchers took naturally occurring peptides and modified them to improve stability and bioactivity. Selank is based on the immune peptide tuftsin. Semax is derived from ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Both were engineered with additional amino acids to resist enzymatic breakdown and extend their duration of action.

By the early 2000s, both peptides had completed clinical trials in Russia and received regulatory approval. Selank was approved as an anxiolytic, and Semax as a nootropic and neuroprotective agent. They're prescribed there for conditions ranging from generalized anxiety to stroke recovery.

## Selank: The Anxiolytic Peptide

### What It Is

Selank (TP-7) is a synthetic heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It's based on tuftsin (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg), an immunomodulatory peptide naturally produced in the body, with a Pro-Gly-Pro tail added for stability.

### How It Works

Selank's mechanisms are multifaceted. The research points to several pathways:

**GABAergic modulation.** Selank appears to influence the GABA system, which is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter network. A study by Seredenin et al. found that Selank enhanced the effects of GABA in the brain, producing anxiolytic effects comparable to benzodiazepines but without the sedation or addiction potential ([Seredenin et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12596521/)).

**Serotonin metabolism.** Research has shown that Selank influences serotonin metabolism, particularly affecting the enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin. This could contribute to its mood-stabilizing properties ([Narkevich et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18683656/)).

**BDNF expression.** Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is critical for neuroplasticity and neuronal survival. Selank has been shown to increase BDNF expression in animal models, which may explain some of its cognitive benefits ([Inozemtseva et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18683655/)).

**Immune modulation.** Remember, Selank is based on tuftsin, an immune peptide. It retains immunomodulatory properties, influencing cytokine expression and immune cell activity. A study published in *Immunology* demonstrated that Selank could modulate the expression of 45 inflammation-related genes ([Kolomin et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23710696/)).

### Research Findings

Clinical studies conducted in Russia have shown Selank to be effective for generalized anxiety disorder, with efficacy comparable to medazepam (a benzodiazepine) but with a better safety profile. Patients showed reduced anxiety scores without significant sedation or cognitive impairment ([Zozulya et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18577217/)).

Animal studies have demonstrated anxiolytic effects across multiple behavioral models. Selank-treated animals show reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze, light-dark box, and other standard anxiety tests.

The immune angle is interesting too. Some research suggests Selank could be beneficial during periods of high stress or immune challenge, though this application needs more clinical data.

## Semax: The Cognitive Enhancer

### What It Is

Semax is a synthetic heptapeptide based on a fragment of ACTH (amino acids 4-7: Met-Glu-His-Phe), with a Pro-Gly-Pro tail added for stability. The full sequence is Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro.

Despite being derived from ACTH, Semax doesn't have the hormonal effects you'd expect from its parent molecule. It doesn't stimulate cortisol production or affect the adrenal glands in any meaningful way. The researchers specifically isolated the cognitive-enhancing fragment while leaving the hormonal activity behind.

### How It Works

**BDNF and NGF upregulation.** This is probably Semax's most well-documented mechanism. Multiple studies have shown that Semax significantly increases the expression of BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the brain. One study found that Semax increased BDNF mRNA expression by up to 1.4-fold in the rat hippocampus and cortex ([Dolotov et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16996037/)).

**Dopaminergic and serotonergic effects.** Semax influences monoamine neurotransmitter systems. Research shows it modulates dopamine and serotonin turnover in the brain, which contributes to its effects on attention, motivation, and mood ([Eremin et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16353768/)).

**Neuroprotection.** In models of ischemic brain injury, Semax has demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects. It appears to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit inflammatory cascades, and support neuronal survival in oxygen-deprived conditions ([Gusev et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16447576/)).

**Gene expression.** A fascinating study by Agapova et al. found that Semax affected the expression of a wide range of genes related to the immune system and vascular function in rat brain tissue after ischemic stroke ([Agapova et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18044688/)).

### Research Findings

In Russia, Semax has been used clinically for:

- **Stroke recovery.** This is its primary approved indication. Clinical studies have shown improved neurological outcomes when Semax is administered during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.
- **Cognitive enhancement.** Studies in healthy volunteers showed improved memory, attention, and mental performance following Semax administration.
- **ADHD.** Preliminary research suggests potential benefits for attention deficit conditions, though the data is limited.
- **Optic nerve atrophy.** Semax is approved in Russia for certain optic nerve conditions, with studies showing improved visual function.

One Russian clinical trial involving stroke patients found that intranasal Semax administration within the first 12 hours of ischemic stroke led to significantly better neurological outcomes compared to standard treatment alone ([Gusev et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16447576/)).

## How Selank and Semax Differ

Despite both being Russian nootropic peptides administered the same way, Selank and Semax are quite different in their primary effects.

| Aspect | Selank | Semax |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Parent molecule | Tuftsin (immune peptide) | ACTH (stress hormone fragment) |
| Primary effect | Anxiolytic, calming | Cognitive enhancement, stimulating |
| Key mechanism | GABA modulation, serotonin | BDNF/NGF upregulation, dopamine |
| Best for | Anxiety, stress, immune support | Focus, memory, neuroprotection |
| Subjective feel | Calm clarity | Motivated alertness |
| Energy effect | Neutral to mildly calming | Mildly stimulating |

Think of it this way: Selank quiets the noise, and Semax sharpens the signal. Both improve cognitive function, but they approach it from opposite directions.

## Why Nasal Sprays? The Intranasal Advantage

Both Selank and Semax are primarily administered as nasal sprays. This isn't just for convenience. The nasal route provides direct access to the brain via the olfactory pathway, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and first-pass metabolism.

Intranasal delivery offers several advantages for these peptides:

- **Rapid onset.** Effects are typically felt within 15 to 30 minutes.
- **Higher brain bioavailability.** More of the peptide reaches the central nervous system compared to subcutaneous injection.
- **Easy self-administration.** No needles required.
- **Good absorption.** The nasal mucosa is highly vascularized and provides efficient peptide absorption.

Most formulations come as pre-mixed nasal spray solutions. Some users reconstitute lyophilized powder into saline solution for nasal use. Either approach works, though pre-mixed formulations are more convenient.

**Proper nasal spray technique matters.** Tilt your head slightly forward, insert the nozzle, and spray while gently inhaling. Don't tilt your head back or sniff hard, as this sends the solution to the back of the throat rather than keeping it in contact with the nasal mucosa.

## Dosing

### Selank Dosing

- **Standard dose:** 250 to 500 mcg per day intranasally
- **Typical protocol:** One spray per nostril, 2 to 3 times daily
- **Cycle length:** 14 to 30 days, with breaks between cycles
- **Onset:** Effects usually noticeable within the first few days
- **Russian clinical doses:** Up to 750 mcg per day in some studies

### Semax Dosing

- **Standard dose:** 200 to 600 mcg per day intranasally
- **Typical protocol:** One to two sprays per nostril, 2 to 3 times daily
- **Cycle length:** 10 to 30 days, with breaks between cycles
- **Onset:** Often noticeable within 30 minutes of first dose
- **Russian clinical doses:** Up to 1200 mcg per day for stroke patients (under medical supervision)

There's also a modified version called N-Acetyl Semax Amidate (NASA) that some users prefer. It's claimed to be more potent and longer-lasting, though formal research on this specific analog is limited.

Start at the lower end of the dosing range and adjust based on your response. And as always, these are reference points from the literature and community experience, not medical prescriptions.

## Side Effects

Both peptides have favorable safety profiles based on available research and clinical use in Russia.

### Selank Side Effects

- Generally very well tolerated
- Occasional mild nasal irritation
- Rare reports of fatigue or drowsiness (usually at higher doses)
- No significant withdrawal effects reported
- No dependency or tolerance observed in studies

### Semax Side Effects

- Generally well tolerated
- Nasal irritation or dryness
- Occasional headache, particularly at higher doses
- Some users report mild irritability (the stimulatory effect can be too much for sensitive individuals)
- Hair growth has been reported anecdotally (related to neurotrophic factor upregulation)
- No significant withdrawal effects

Neither peptide has shown the kind of serious adverse effects associated with pharmaceutical anxiolytics or stimulants. That said, long-term safety data outside of Russian clinical practice is limited.

## The Selank + Semax Stack: Calm Focus in Practice

Given their complementary mechanisms, combining Selank and Semax is a popular approach. The logic is straightforward: Selank handles the anxiety and stress side while Semax provides the cognitive boost. Together, you get calm focus.

**A common stack protocol:**

- **Morning:** Semax 200 to 400 mcg intranasally for focus and motivation
- **Afternoon/Evening:** Selank 250 to 500 mcg intranasally for anxiety relief and calm
- **Or:** Both in the morning at moderate doses for balanced effects throughout the day

Some people use them at the same time, alternating nostrils. Others separate them by a few hours. There's no formal research on the combination, but the mechanisms don't conflict, and anecdotal reports are generally positive.

If you're new to either peptide, try them individually first. Get a sense of how each one affects you before combining. This lets you troubleshoot if something doesn't feel right.

## Legal Status of Selank and Semax

This is where things get a bit complicated. For a full breakdown of peptide regulations, see our [2026 peptide legality guide](/articles/are-peptides-legal-fda-regulations-2026).

**In Russia:** Both peptides are approved prescription medications. Selank is classified as an anxiolytic, and Semax as a nootropic. They're widely available through pharmacies.

**In the United States:** Neither peptide is FDA-approved. They're not scheduled as controlled substances, but they exist in a gray area. They can be obtained through research chemical suppliers or, in some cases, through compounding pharmacies. The FDA has not issued specific guidance on either peptide.

**In the EU:** Generally unregulated but not approved as medicines. Availability varies by country.

**In Australia:** Peptides face stricter regulation. Both would likely require a prescription through specialized pathways.

**In Canada:** Similar to the US, they occupy a gray zone. Not approved, not specifically prohibited.

The regulatory environment for peptides is shifting. Several countries have tightened restrictions on research peptides in recent years. Check your local regulations before purchasing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I take Selank or Semax if I'm on antidepressants?

Both peptides interact with serotonergic systems, so caution is warranted if you're taking SSRIs or other serotonergic medications. The risk of serotonin syndrome is likely low given the mild serotonergic effects, but consult your doctor before combining. Don't stop prescribed medications to try peptides.

### How do these compare to pharmaceutical nootropics like modafinil?

Different tools for different situations. Modafinil is a strong wakefulness-promoting agent that works primarily through dopamine reuptake inhibition. Semax is gentler, with broader neurotrophic effects. Selank is more comparable to a mild anxiolytic. The peptides won't hit as hard as modafinil for raw wakefulness, but they offer benefits (like neurotrophic support) that modafinil doesn't.

### Do the effects build over time or are they immediate?

Both. Semax has noticeable acute effects within 30 minutes (improved focus, mental clarity). But the neurotrophic effects (BDNF upregulation, neuroplasticity) build over days to weeks of consistent use. Selank's anxiolytic effects are often noticed within the first few days, with full benefits developing over 1 to 2 weeks.

### Can I use these peptides long-term?

Russian clinical practice includes cycling protocols rather than continuous use. Typical cycles are 2 to 4 weeks on, followed by a break of similar length. Whether long-term continuous use is safe hasn't been adequately studied. Cycling is the prudent approach.

### Are there oral versions available?

Both peptides are primarily designed for intranasal use. Oral bioavailability would be very low for both due to enzymatic degradation. Sublingual administration has been tried by some users but isn't well-studied. Stick with intranasal for best results.

### What's the shelf life?

Reconstituted solutions should be refrigerated and used within 4 to 6 weeks. See our [peptide storage guide](/articles/how-to-store-peptides) for best practices. Lyophilized powder stored properly (cool, dry, dark) can last much longer, potentially years. Pre-mixed nasal sprays usually have expiration dates on the packaging.

### Will these show up on a drug test?

Standard workplace drug tests screen for specific substances (amphetamines, opioids, THC, etc.) and would not detect either peptide. Athletic drug testing is a different matter. WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) has rules about peptide hormones, though Selank and Semax don't fall neatly into current prohibited categories. If you're a competitive athlete, check with your sport's anti-doping authority.

## The Bottom Line

Selank and Semax represent some of the most interesting nootropic peptides available today. They come with a stronger clinical backing than most compounds in the peptide space, thanks to decades of Russian research and actual regulatory approval in that country.

Selank is your choice if anxiety and stress are your primary concerns. Semax is better suited if you're after cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. And combining them gives you the best of both worlds.

The main limitation is the lack of Western clinical trials. Most of the research was published in Russian journals, and while much of it has been translated, the studies don't always meet the methodological standards expected by Western regulatory bodies. That doesn't mean the science is wrong. It just means there's a gap that hasn't been filled yet.

If you're interested in trying either peptide, start low, go slow, and keep notes on your response. You might also want to explore [Cerebrolysin](/articles/cerebrolysin-neuropeptide-guide) for a different approach to neurotrophic support. These aren't miracle compounds, but for the right person, they can be genuinely helpful tools for cognitive optimization and stress management.
