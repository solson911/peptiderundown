# Melanotan 2: Tanning Peptide Benefits, Risks, and Dosing

Melanotan 2 is one of the most popular and most controversial peptides in the cosmetic space. It darkens your skin without a tanning bed.

It can boost libido. It may suppress appetite. And it carries real risks that anyone considering it needs to understand.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - Melanotan 2 produces real eumelanin (dark pigment) by stimulating **MC1R receptors** on melanocytes
> - Side effects include nausea, facial flushing, mole darkening, and strong sexual arousal from **MC4R activation**
> - The **melanoma risk question remains unanswered** — anyone with a personal or family history should avoid MT-2
> - MT-2 is **not FDA-approved** and sits in a legal gray area in most countries

## What Is Melanotan 2?

Melanotan 2 (MT-2) is a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a naturally occurring hormone that regulates skin pigmentation.

It was originally developed at the University of Arizona in the 1990s as a potential preventive treatment for skin cancer. The idea: if you could darken people's skin without UV exposure, you could protect them from UV damage.

The compound never made it through formal drug development. But it found a second life in the underground peptide market for cosmetic tanning and its sexual side effects.

MT-2 is closely related to **bremelanotide (PT-141)**, which was derived from MT-2 research and eventually received FDA approval for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women.

## How Melanotan 2 Works

MT-2 is a non-selective agonist of melanocortin receptors, particularly MC1R through MC5R.

### Receptor Activity and Effects

| Receptor | Location | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **MC1R** | Melanocytes (skin) | Skin darkening, eumelanin production |
| **MC3R** | Brain, gut | Energy balance, fat metabolism |
| **MC4R** | Hypothalamus | Sexual arousal, appetite suppression |
| **MC5R** | Various | Sebaceous gland regulation |

### MC1R: The Tanning Cascade

1. **MT-2 binds to MC1R** on melanocytes
2. **Activates adenylate cyclase** — increases intracellular cAMP
3. **cAMP activates protein kinase A** — upregulates tyrosinase
4. **More melanin produced** and transferred to surrounding skin cells
5. **Skin darkens progressively** over days to weeks

> **Key Distinction:** MT-2 produces **eumelanin**, the dark brown/black pigment that actually provides UV protection. This is different from pheomelanin (the reddish pigment in fair-skinned, red-haired individuals), which doesn't protect against UV and may generate free radicals.

MT-2 can be particularly effective for fair-skinned individuals whose melanocytes can produce eumelanin but typically don't. Some UV exposure is still needed to optimize the tan, but far less than without the peptide.

### MC4R: Sexual and Appetite Effects

**Sexual arousal** from MC4R activation in the hypothalamus is often the most noticeable effect, sometimes occurring before any visible skin darkening. This effect was so pronounced that researchers developed **PT-141 (bremelanotide)** specifically to target it, receiving FDA approval in 2019 as Vyleesi ([Clayton et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27045258/)).

**Appetite suppression** through MC4R is also real but inconsistent and usually not dramatic ([Adan et al., 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16803859/)).

## What to Expect: Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **First injection** | Hours | Sexual arousal effects, possible nausea and flushing |
| **Loading (Week 1-2)** | 5-10 days | Skin darkening begins; fair skin may take longer |
| **Loading (Week 2-3)** | 2-3 weeks | Color develops, may appear slightly uneven initially |
| **Full tan** | 3-4 weeks | Desired shade reached, even distribution |
| **Maintenance** | Ongoing | Less frequent dosing maintains color |
| **After stopping** | 1-3 months | Tan fades gradually as skin cells turn over |

### Moles and Freckles

MT-2 **will** darken existing moles and freckles. New moles may also appear. This is both a cosmetic concern and a safety consideration. If you have moles, monitor them closely during and after use.

## Dosing Protocols

MT-2 is administered via subcutaneous injection, typically into the abdominal fat. For technique, see our [subcutaneous injection guide](/articles/how-to-inject-peptides-subcutaneously).

Need help with dosing math? Use our free [Peptide Reconstitution Calculator](https://peptidearc.com/tools/reconstitution) on PeptideArc.

### Reconstitution

MT-2 typically comes as lyophilized powder in **10 mg vials**. Adding 1 mL of bacteriostatic water gives a concentration of 10 mg/mL for easy dose measurement.

### Loading Phase Protocol

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Starting dose** | 0.1-0.25 mg (assess tolerance) |
| **Working dose** | 0.25-0.5 mg |
| **Frequency** | Once daily, preferably evening |
| **Duration** | 2-4 weeks or until desired tan |
| **UV exposure** | Brief sessions (10-20 min), 2-3x/week |

### Maintenance Phase Protocol

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Dose** | 0.25-0.5 mg |
| **Frequency** | Once or twice per week |
| **UV exposure** | Minimal, once per week or as needed |

### Dosing Tips

- **Start low** — nausea is dose-dependent; 0.1 mg lets your body adjust
- **Evening dosing** — sleep through the worst of the nausea
- **Antihistamines** — diphenhydramine 30 minutes before injection can reduce nausea and flushing
- **Don't chase results** — higher doses increase side effects without proportionally improving tanning
- **Rotate injection sites** — prevents local irritation

### Storage

Reconstituted MT-2 should be refrigerated and used within **4-6 weeks**. For detailed storage tips, see our [peptide storage guide](/articles/how-to-store-peptides). Unreconstituted powder lasts longer refrigerated or frozen.

## Side Effects

For a broader overview of peptide side effects, see our [peptide side effects guide](/articles/peptide-side-effects-what-to-know).

### Common Side Effects

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Nausea** | 50-70% | Worst early on, improves with tolerance |
| **Facial flushing** | Common | 15-30 min after injection, lasts 30-60 min |
| **Fatigue/drowsiness** | Common | Another reason for evening dosing |
| **Appetite suppression** | Mild | Can be welcome for some |
| **Injection site reactions** | Common | Minor redness, itching |

### Less Common Side Effects

| Side Effect | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Spontaneous erections** | Pronounced MC4R effect in men |
| **Mole/freckle darkening** | Essentially universal with sufficient use |
| **New mole formation** | Reported by some users |
| **Stomach cramping** | Accompanies nausea, resolves similarly |
| **Dizziness** | Occasional, mild, transient |

### Rare or Serious

- **Melanoma risk** — see dedicated section below
- **Rhabdomyolysis** — extremely rare case reports, unclear causality
- **Priapism** — prolonged erections at higher doses, requiring medical attention

## The Melanoma Question

> **Important:** The melanoma risk question is unresolved. If you have a personal or family history of melanoma, **do not use MT-2**.

### The Theoretical Concern

Melanoma develops from melanocytes, the same cells MT-2 stimulates. Chronic stimulation could theoretically promote malignant transformation.

### Evidence Summary

| Evidence Type | Finding |
|--------------|---------|
| **Case reports** | Melanoma diagnoses in MT-2 users reported ([Hjuler et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25899937/)), but can't establish causation |
| **Animal data** | MT-2 did not promote melanoma growth in one mouse model ([Langan et al., 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19175862/)) |
| **Mechanistic concern** | Melanocyte activation could accelerate pre-existing atypical cells |
| **Population data** | No large-scale epidemiological studies exist |

### Practical Guidance

- **Personal or family history of melanoma** — do not use MT-2
- **Atypical or many moles** — risk calculus gets worse
- **If using MT-2** — monitor skin carefully, get regular dermatologist checks
- **Mole darkening** — makes self-monitoring harder, which is itself a safety concern
- **Minimize UV exposure** — reduces one known risk factor regardless

## Other Safety Considerations

### Purity and Contamination

MT-2 is not pharmaceutical grade. Studies analyzing online peptides have found purity issues, incorrect dosing, and contamination ([Cohen et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36683093/)). Buy from suppliers providing third-party COAs showing HPLC purity and endotoxin testing.

### Long-Term Effects

MT-2 has been used recreationally for 15-20 years. No systematic long-term data exists. We genuinely don't know what 10+ years of intermittent melanocyte stimulation does.

### UV Interaction

MT-2 makes you more responsive to UV. The eumelanin it produces is protective, but UV still causes DNA damage regardless of melanin levels. Use reasonable sun exposure practices.

## Legal Status

MT-2 occupies a gray area in most countries. For a full breakdown, see our [peptide regulations guide](/articles/are-peptides-legal-fda-regulations-2026).

| Country | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **United States** | Not FDA-approved, not scheduled; sold as "research chemical" |
| **United Kingdom** | Illegal to sell, legal to possess for personal use |
| **Australia** | Schedule 4 (prescription-only); importing without prescription is illegal |
| **European Union** | Not approved; regulations vary by country |
| **Canada** | Not approved; available from research suppliers |

The regulatory situation could change. Several countries have discussed tightening regulations on cosmetic peptides.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take for MT-2 to work?

Most users notice skin darkening within **5-10 days**. A full tan typically takes **3-4 weeks**. Fair-skinned individuals may take slightly longer.

### Do you still need sun exposure with MT-2?

Some UV helps activate and distribute the melanin, but far less than tanning without MT-2. Brief exposures of **10-20 minutes** a few times per week are typically sufficient. Some users report darkening without deliberate sun exposure.

### How long does the tan last after stopping?

The tan fades gradually over **1-3 months** as melanin-containing skin cells turn over. Maintenance dosing preserves the color indefinitely.

### Can women use MT-2?

Yes. MT-2 works the same way in women. Women also commonly experience the sexual arousal effects. Dosing protocols are the same regardless of sex.

### Is MT-2 the same as PT-141?

No. PT-141 (bremelanotide) was derived from MT-2 research but is a cyclic peptide fragment designed to target MC4R for sexual effects without tanning. PT-141 is FDA-approved (as Vyleesi). MT-2 is not.

### What's the difference between Melanotan 1 and Melanotan 2?

| Feature | Melanotan 1 (Afamelanotide) | Melanotan 2 |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Selectivity** | More selective MC1R agonist | Non-selective (MC1R-MC5R) |
| **Tanning effect** | Yes | Yes |
| **Sexual side effects** | Minimal | Significant |
| **Nausea** | Less | More |
| **Approved use** | EU-approved (Scenesse) for EPP | Not approved anywhere |
| **Availability** | Harder to obtain, more expensive | Widely available |

### Will MT-2 protect me from sunburn?

The eumelanin provides some UV protection. Many users tolerate more sun without burning. But it's not sunscreen. UV still causes DNA damage regardless of melanin levels.

### Can MT-2 cause permanent skin changes?

The tan itself is temporary. But new moles or darkened existing moles may persist after stopping. Dermatological monitoring is important.

## The Bottom Line

MT-2 works for tanning. That's not really in question.

It produces real melanin, creates a natural-looking tan, and does so with minimal UV exposure. The sexual side effects are a bonus for many users.

But it's not without real risks. The melanoma question hangs over the compound, and the honest answer is that we don't have enough data to know for sure.

Add in the lack of regulation, potential purity issues, and unknown long-term safety profile, and you have a compound that demands informed decision-making.

If you choose to use MT-2, start with low doses, monitor your skin carefully, get regular dermatologist checks, and stay honest with yourself about the risk-benefit tradeoff.
