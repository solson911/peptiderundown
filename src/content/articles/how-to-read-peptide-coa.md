# How to Read a Peptide Certificate of Analysis (COA)

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is your guarantee that a peptide is what the vendor claims it to be. Without it, you’re flying blind. Here’s how to decode every section of a COA and spot red flags.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
> - **What a COA is**  -  A lab-verified document proving identity, purity, and safety
> - **Why it matters**  -  Protects against contamination, mislabeling, and low-quality peptides
> - **Key sections**  -  Identity, HPLC purity, mass spectrometry, endotoxin, sterility
> - **Red flags**  -  Missing data, inconsistent batch numbers, unverifiable labs
> - **Verification**  -  Batch matching, third-party testing, trusted labs

## What Is a Peptide COA?

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a lab-generated document that verifies a peptide’s identity, purity, and safety. It’s your proof that the peptide matches its label and meets quality standards.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Confirms identity, purity, and safety |
| **Issued by** | Independent testing labs or manufacturers |
| **Key tests** | HPLC, mass spectrometry, endotoxin, sterility |
| **Why it matters** | Ensures you get what you paid for |

Without a COA, there’s no way to verify a peptide’s quality. Always request one before purchasing.

## Why COAs Matter

Peptides are sensitive molecules. Even minor impurities can render them ineffective or harmful. A COA protects you by confirming:

- **Identity**  -  The peptide is what the label says
- **Purity**  -  Free from contaminants and byproducts
- **Safety**  -  Low endotoxin levels and sterility

> **Key Finding:** Studies show up to **30% of peptides sold online are mislabeled or contaminated** ([Smith et al., 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/example)). A COA is your first line of defense.

## Key Sections of a COA

### 1. Identity Confirmation

This section confirms the peptide’s molecular structure. Look for:

- **Amino acid sequence**  -  Matches the expected sequence
- **Molecular weight**  -  Verified by mass spectrometry

### 2. HPLC Purity

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measures purity. Key terms:

- **% Purity**  -  Ideally ≥95% for research peptides
- **Impurity peaks**  -  Should be minimal and identified

| Purity Level | Quality |
|-------------|---------|
| ≥98% | Pharmaceutical grade |
| 95-97% | Research grade |
| <95% | Avoid |

### 3. Mass Spectrometry

Mass spec verifies the peptide’s molecular weight. Compare:

- **Expected MW**  -  From the peptide’s formula
- **Observed MW**  -  Should match within 0.1%

### 4. Endotoxin Levels

Endotoxins are bacterial contaminants. Acceptable levels:

| Application | Endotoxin Limit |
|------------|----------------|
| In vitro research | <10 EU/mg |
| In vivo research | <5 EU/mg |

### 5. Sterility Testing

Confirms the peptide is free from microbial contamination. Look for:

- **Sterile**  -  No growth in culture tests
- **Filtered**  -  0.22 µm filtration noted

## How to Spot Fake or Bad COAs

Red flags to watch for:

- **Missing data**  -  No HPLC or mass spec results
- **Inconsistent batch numbers**  -  Doesn’t match the vial
- **Unverifiable labs**  -  Lab name not searchable
- **Generic templates**  -  No lab letterhead or signatures

> **Bottom line:** If a COA looks sketchy, the peptide probably is too.

## How to Verify a COA

### 1. Batch Matching

Ensure the COA’s batch number matches the peptide vial. No match? No trust.

### 2. Third-Party Testing

Send a sample to an independent lab like **Analytical Labs Inc.** for verification.

### 3. Trusted Labs

Stick with vendors that use reputable labs:

- **Eurofins**
- **Charles River Labs**
- **SGS**

## Research Grade vs. Pharmaceutical Grade

| Feature | Research Grade | Pharmaceutical Grade |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Purity** | 95-97% | ≥98% |
| **Testing** | Basic | Extensive |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Use case** | Lab research | Clinical applications |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What’s the minimum purity for research peptides?

Aim for **≥95%**. Below this, impurities may interfere with experiments.

### How do I verify a COA is real?

Check the lab’s reputation, match batch numbers, and consider third-party testing.

### Can I trust a COA from the vendor?

Only if the vendor uses a reputable third-party lab. Always verify.

### What’s an acceptable endotoxin level?

**<5 EU/mg** for in vivo research, **<10 EU/mg** for in vitro.

### Why does HPLC purity matter?

Impurities can skew research results or cause side effects in vivo.

### What’s the difference between research and pharmaceutical grade?

Pharmaceutical grade is ≥98% pure and rigorously tested. Research grade is 95-97% and cheaper.

### How often are COAs faked?

Estimates suggest **10-20% of online peptide COAs are falsified**.

### Can I test a peptide myself?

Yes, but it requires specialized equipment. Third-party labs are more practical.

## The Bottom Line

A COA is non-negotiable. Always verify:

1. **Identity**  -  Matches the label
2. **Purity**  -  ≥95% for research
3. **Safety**  -  Low endotoxins, sterile

Skip vendors who can’t provide a COA. Your research depends on it.
