# AOD-9604: The Fat Loss Fragment of Growth Hormone

Growth hormone burns fat. That's been known for decades.

The problem? It also grows bones, organs, and tumors. Not exactly a clean trade-off for dropping a few pounds.

AOD-9604 was designed to fix that. Researchers took the fat-burning piece of human growth hormone, modified it slightly, and created a peptide that targets fat metabolism without the dangerous growth effects.

The result is one of the most studied fat loss peptides in history. Whether it actually works as well as early research suggested is a more complicated story.

## What Is AOD-9604?

AOD-9604 (Anti-Obesity Drug 9604) is a synthetic peptide consisting of **16 amino acids**. It corresponds to the C-terminal fragment of human growth hormone (amino acids 176-191), with an added tyrosine residue at the N-terminus.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Synthetic modified peptide fragment |
| **Parent molecule** | Human growth hormone (hGH) |
| **Region** | Amino acids 176-191 + tyrosine |
| **Molecular weight** | ~1,817 Da |
| **Primary research focus** | Fat metabolism, obesity |
| **FDA status** | Not approved |
| **TGA status (Australia)** | Approved as supplement ingredient |

The peptide was originally developed at **Monash University** in Melbourne, Australia, during the 1990s. Metabolic Pharmaceuticals Ltd later licensed it and pushed it through clinical trials.

## How AOD-9604 Works

The basic idea behind AOD-9604 is straightforward: isolate the fat-burning activity of growth hormone from everything else.

### Lipolysis Without Growth

Full-length growth hormone triggers fat breakdown through its C-terminal region. AOD-9604 mimics this specific activity.

Key mechanisms:

- **Stimulates lipolysis** - increases the breakdown of stored triglycerides in adipose tissue
- **Inhibits lipogenesis** - reduces the formation of new fat from non-fat food sources like carbohydrates
- **Does not affect IGF-1 levels** - meaning no growth-promoting effects on bones, organs, or tissues
- **Does not alter blood glucose** - no diabetogenic effects seen in trials

([Ng et al., 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10985860/))

### The Beta-3 Adrenergic Connection

Research suggests AOD-9604 works partly through the beta-3 adrenergic receptor pathway. This is the same pathway activated during cold exposure and exercise.

- **Beta-3 receptors** sit primarily on fat cells
- **Activation increases** cyclic AMP and hormone-sensitive lipase activity
- **Fat cells release** stored fatty acids into the bloodstream for burning

> **Key Finding:** AOD-9604 stimulated lipolysis in both human and animal fat tissue without any of the metabolic disruptions caused by full growth hormone treatment.

([Heffernan et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11146367/))

### No Growth Effects

This is the central selling point. Full-length HGH causes a long list of problems when used for fat loss:

| Effect | Full HGH | AOD-9604 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Fat breakdown** | Yes | Yes |
| **IGF-1 elevation** | Yes | No |
| **Blood sugar increase** | Yes | No |
| **Bone/cartilage growth** | Yes | No |
| **Organ enlargement** | Yes | No |
| **Water retention** | Yes | No |
| **Carpal tunnel risk** | Yes | No |

That clean separation is what made AOD-9604 attractive as a potential obesity drug in the first place.

([Ng and Borgeois, 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17875231/))

## Research History

AOD-9604 has a longer research timeline than most peptides in the fat loss space. The story starts in the early 1990s and includes both promising preclinical results and underwhelming clinical outcomes.

### Preclinical Studies (1990s)

Researchers at Monash University first identified that the C-terminal fragment of growth hormone could reduce body fat in animal models.

- **Obese mice** treated with the hGH fragment lost significant body fat
- **Lean mice** showed no abnormal weight loss, suggesting targeted action on excess fat
- **No antibody formation** against the peptide, indicating low immunogenicity

([Ng et al., 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10985860/))

### Obese Zucker Rat Studies

The Zucker rat is a genetic model of obesity. These animals develop severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction.

| Parameter | Result with AOD-9604 |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Body weight** | Significant reduction vs. controls |
| **Fat mass** | Reduced without lean mass loss |
| **Food intake** | No change (not an appetite suppressant) |
| **IGF-1 levels** | No increase |
| **Blood glucose** | No change |

> **Important:** AOD-9604 reduced fat without suppressing appetite. The mechanism is purely metabolic, not behavioral.

### Phase 1 Clinical Trial

Metabolic Pharmaceuticals conducted a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in the early 2000s.

- AOD-9604 was well tolerated at multiple dose levels
- No serious adverse events reported
- Pharmacokinetics supported once-daily oral dosing
- No effects on IGF-1, insulin, or cortisol

### Phase 2 Clinical Trials

The pivotal moment came with two Phase 2 trials in obese subjects.

**Phase 2a (2004):**

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Participants** | 300 obese adults |
| **Duration** | 12 weeks |
| **Design** | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled |
| **Route** | Oral capsule |
| **Doses tested** | 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg daily |

**Results:**

| Group | Average Weight Loss |
|-------|-------------------|
| **1 mg** | 1.6 kg (statistically significant vs. placebo) |
| **5 mg** | Not statistically significant |
| **10 mg** | Not statistically significant |
| **20 mg** | Not statistically significant |
| **Placebo** | 0.8 kg |

The results were mixed. Only the lowest dose hit statistical significance, and the overall magnitude of weight loss was modest.

**Phase 2b:**

A larger trial followed with over 500 participants. The results were similarly underwhelming. Weight loss differences between AOD-9604 and placebo were small and inconsistent across dose groups.

> **Bottom line:** The clinical trial results did not match the dramatic preclinical findings. AOD-9604 was safe, but the fat loss in humans was modest at best when taken orally.

### Why the Disconnect?

Several factors may explain why human results lagged behind animal data:

- **Oral bioavailability** - peptides are notoriously difficult to absorb through the gut
- **Dose optimization** - the effective dose range may not have been identified
- **Species differences** - rodent fat metabolism responds differently than human
- **Study duration** - 12 weeks may not capture the full effect curve

Metabolic Pharmaceuticals ultimately failed to secure further funding. The company ceased operations, and AOD-9604 never advanced to Phase 3 trials as a standalone obesity treatment.

## Current Research and Applications

Despite the clinical trial setbacks, AOD-9604 didn't disappear. It found new life in several areas.

### Cartilage Repair

Surprisingly, AOD-9604 showed potential in musculoskeletal research. Studies indicate it may stimulate cartilage repair and protect against degenerative changes.

- **In vitro studies** showed increased proteoglycan and collagen synthesis in chondrocytes
- **Animal models** of osteoarthritis showed reduced joint degeneration
- **Calithera Biosciences** investigated intra-articular injections for knee osteoarthritis

([Kwon et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22082749/))

### Australian TGA Approval

In 2010, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration approved AOD-9604 as a food substance. This means it can be included in over-the-counter supplements in Australia.

This was based on its demonstrated safety profile, not its efficacy as a weight loss agent. The approval essentially classified it as safe for human consumption.

### Compounding Pharmacy Use

In the United States, AOD-9604 has become popular through compounding pharmacies and peptide clinics. It's typically prescribed as a subcutaneous injection rather than the oral form used in clinical trials.

The subcutaneous route bypasses the oral bioavailability problem, delivering the peptide directly into systemic circulation. Many practitioners believe this is why clinical users report better results than the oral trials suggested.

## Dosing

> **Important:** These are research-based protocols commonly reported in clinical settings, not FDA-approved prescriptions. Always work with a qualified provider.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Dose range** | 250-300 mcg per day |
| **Frequency** | Once daily |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Timing** | Morning, on an empty stomach |
| **Cycle length** | 12-20 weeks |
| **Common protocol** | 300 mcg daily for 12 weeks, then reassess |

### Why Fasted?

AOD-9604 is typically administered in a fasted state, at least 30 minutes before eating. The reasoning: elevated insulin levels after meals may blunt the lipolytic effect.

This mirrors how growth hormone itself works. GH-mediated fat breakdown is suppressed when insulin is high.

### Reconstitution

AOD-9604 comes as a lyophilized powder. For injection preparation, see our [reconstitution guide](/articles/how-to-reconstitute-peptides).

Standard reconstitution:

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Solvent** | Bacteriostatic water |
| **Volume** | Typically 2-3 mL per 5 mg vial |
| **Storage** | Refrigerate after reconstitution |
| **Shelf life** | Use within 28 days once reconstituted |

### Stacking

Some practitioners combine AOD-9604 with other peptides for fat loss. Common combinations include:

- **AOD-9604 + CJC-1295/Ipamorelin** - adding growth hormone secretagogue support
- **AOD-9604 + BPC-157** - combining fat loss with tissue repair
- **AOD-9604 + Tesamorelin** - targeting both subcutaneous and visceral fat

## Side Effects

AOD-9604 has one of the cleanest safety profiles in the peptide space. Clinical trials showed minimal adverse events compared to placebo.

### Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Injection site irritation** | Occasional | Mild redness, resolves quickly |
| **Headache** | Uncommon | Reported in clinical trials at similar rates to placebo |
| **Mild nausea** | Rare | Usually transient |
| **Flu-like symptoms** | Rare | Reported in early trial days, typically resolves |

### What Hasn't Been Reported

Unlike full growth hormone, AOD-9604 has **not** been associated with:

- Blood sugar elevation
- Joint pain or swelling
- Water retention
- Carpal tunnel symptoms
- Increased cancer risk markers

### When to Stop

- **Persistent injection site reactions** - redness, swelling, or pain that doesn't resolve
- **Unusual swelling** - particularly in extremities (would suggest unintended GH-like activity, though not reported)
- **Allergic reaction** - difficulty breathing, hives, facial swelling

> **Important:** The long-term safety profile beyond 12-24 weeks is not well characterized. Extended use should be monitored by a healthcare provider.

## AOD-9604 vs. Other Fat Loss Peptides

How does AOD-9604 stack up against the other options?

| Feature | AOD-9604 | Tesamorelin | Semaglutide | CJC-1295/Ipamorelin |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Direct lipolysis | GH release (targets visceral fat) | GLP-1 appetite suppression | GH secretagogue |
| **Weight loss magnitude** | Modest | Moderate (visceral fat) | Significant (15-24%) | Mild-moderate |
| **Appetite suppression** | No | No | Strong | No |
| **IGF-1 increase** | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| **FDA approved** | No | Yes (HIV lipodystrophy) | Yes (obesity) | No |
| **Side effects** | Minimal | Moderate | GI-heavy | Mild-moderate |
| **Route** | SC injection | SC injection | SC injection | SC injection |
| **Cost** | Low-moderate | High | Very high | Moderate |

### Where AOD-9604 Fits

AOD-9604 occupies a specific niche. It's not the most powerful fat loss tool available. Semaglutide and tirzepatide clearly produce greater weight loss.

But it has advantages that matter to certain people:

- **No appetite changes** - for those who don't want behavioral modification
- **No GH-related risks** - for those concerned about IGF-1, insulin resistance, or growth effects
- **Minimal side effects** - for those who can't tolerate GLP-1 drugs
- **Lower cost** - significantly cheaper than branded GLP-1 medications

> **Bottom line:** AOD-9604 is a mild fat loss peptide with excellent tolerability. It's best suited for people seeking a modest metabolic boost rather than dramatic weight loss.

## Legal Status and Availability

The legal status of AOD-9604 varies significantly by country.

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **United States** | Not FDA-approved; available through compounding pharmacies with a prescription; sold as research chemical |
| **Australia** | TGA-approved as a food/supplement ingredient since 2010 |
| **European Union** | Not approved; regulatory status varies by member state |
| **Canada** | Not approved for therapeutic use |

### FDA and Compounding

In the US, AOD-9604 exists in a gray area. The FDA has not approved it as a drug, but compounding pharmacies have been able to prepare it as a patient-specific prescription.

The FDA's 2023 crackdown on certain compounded peptides (particularly semaglutide) raised questions about other peptides in the compounding space. AOD-9604's status with compounding pharmacies should be confirmed with current regulations.

### WADA Status

AOD-9604 is **not explicitly listed** on the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list. However, WADA's prohibition of growth hormone fragments could theoretically encompass it. Athletes should exercise caution and consult with anti-doping authorities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does AOD-9604 actually do?

AOD-9604 stimulates the breakdown of stored fat (lipolysis) and reduces the creation of new fat (lipogenesis). It does this by mimicking the fat-metabolizing region of human growth hormone without triggering any growth effects.

Think of it as a targeted excerpt. You get the fat-burning chapter of the growth hormone book without having to read the whole thing.

### How long does it take to see results?

Most clinical protocols ran for 12 weeks. Anecdotal reports from peptide clinics suggest noticeable changes in body composition around weeks 4-6 when combined with proper diet and exercise.

Don't expect dramatic overnight changes. AOD-9604 is a slow burner, not a crash diet.

### Is AOD-9604 the same as HGH fragment 176-191?

Almost. The terms are often used interchangeably, but there's a technical difference.

- **HGH fragment 176-191** refers to the unmodified C-terminal fragment
- **AOD-9604** is the same fragment with an added **tyrosine** residue at position 1

The tyrosine addition was made to improve stability. In practice, the two peptides have very similar activity.

### Does AOD-9604 affect blood sugar?

No. Multiple clinical studies confirmed that AOD-9604 does not alter fasting glucose, insulin levels, or HbA1c. This is one of its key advantages over full growth hormone.

### Can I take AOD-9604 orally?

The clinical trials used oral capsules. But oral bioavailability of peptides is notoriously poor. Most current users and clinics prefer subcutaneous injection for better absorption and more consistent results.

### Is AOD-9604 safe long-term?

The available safety data covers up to 24 weeks in clinical trials. No serious adverse events were reported.

Long-term data beyond that window is limited. If you're considering extended use, regular check-ins with a healthcare provider are recommended.

### Can I combine AOD-9604 with GLP-1 drugs?

There's no published research on this specific combination. In theory, the mechanisms don't conflict: AOD-9604 targets fat metabolism directly while GLP-1 drugs suppress appetite.

Some peptide clinics do prescribe them together. But without formal interaction studies, caution is warranted. Discuss this with your prescribing provider.

### Why didn't AOD-9604 get FDA approval?

The Phase 2 clinical trials showed statistically modest weight loss that didn't meet the bar for further investment. Metabolic Pharmaceuticals ran out of funding, and no other company picked up development for the obesity indication.

It's worth noting that the trials used oral dosing. Whether subcutaneous administration would have produced different results is an open question that was never formally tested in a large trial.

## The Bottom Line

AOD-9604 is a peptide with a compelling theory behind it. Taking the fat-burning piece of growth hormone and stripping away the risks was a smart approach. The preclinical data was genuinely promising.

The human clinical data, however, told a more restrained story. Oral AOD-9604 produced modest weight loss that didn't justify the investment needed for Phase 3 trials. The peptide's second life as an injectable compound through clinics and compounding pharmacies may deliver better results, but that hasn't been validated in controlled trials.

For people looking for a low-risk, mild fat loss peptide with minimal side effects, AOD-9604 remains a reasonable option. For people seeking significant weight loss, the GLP-1 class (semaglutide, tirzepatide) offers far more proven results.

AOD-9604 isn't a failure. It's a niche tool. And in the right context, niche tools still have value.
