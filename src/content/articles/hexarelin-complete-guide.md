# HEXARELIN  -  Complete Guide

Hexarelin stands out as the most potent synthetic growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP) developed to date. Unlike other GHRPs, it offers unique cardioprotective benefits while stimulating significant GH release.

> **Key Takeaways**
>
>- **Most potent GHRP**  -  stronger GH release than GHRP-6 or ipamorelin
>- **Cardioprotective effects**  -  shown to improve heart function in preclinical models
>- **Ghrelin receptor agonist**  -  mimics hunger signals but with distinct effects
>- **Dosing flexibility**  -  effective at 1-3 mcg/kg, typically 100-300 mcg per dose
>- **Desensitization risk**  -  requires cycling strategies (2-4 weeks on/off)

## What Is Hexarelin?

Hexarelin is a synthetic hexapeptide (six-amino-acid chain) that mimics ghrelin, the "hunger hormone." It was developed in the 1990s as part of research into growth hormone secretagogues.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Synthetic hexapeptide |
| **Molecular Weight** | 887.03 Da |
| **Sequence** | His-D-2-methyl-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 |
| **Half-life** | ~30 minutes |
| **Primary Use** | Research compound (not FDA approved) |

Hexarelin binds strongly to the ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a), triggering growth hormone release from the pituitary gland.

## How Hexarelin Works

### Mechanism 1: Growth Hormone Secretion

Hexarelin stimulates GH release through multiple pathways:

- **Direct pituitary action**  -  binds GHSR-1a on somatotrophs
- **Hypothalamic signaling**  -  increases GHRH (growth hormone-releasing hormone)
- **Somatostatin inhibition**  -  reduces the main GH suppressor

([Locatelli et al., 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10443691/))

### Mechanism 2: Cardiac Protection

Unique among GHRPs, hexarelin shows cardioprotective effects:

- **Improves cardiac function** in heart failure models
- **Reduces ischemic damage** during heart attacks
- **May stimulate heart cell growth** (cardiomyocyte proliferation)

([Torsello et al., 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825463/))

> **Key Finding:** Hexarelin protects heart tissue during ischemia-reperfusion injury, reducing infarct size by up to 50% in animal models.

## Research and Clinical Data

### Growth Hormone Release

A 1996 study measured GH response to various doses:

| Dose (mcg/kg) | Peak GH Increase | Duration |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **1** | 15-20x baseline | ~2 hours |
| **2** | 25-30x baseline | ~3 hours |
| **3** | 30-40x baseline | ~4 hours |

([Ghigo et al., 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8815806/))

### Cardiac Effects

Animal studies show consistent benefits:

- **38% reduction** in infarct size after coronary occlusion
- **Improved ejection fraction** in heart failure models
- **Preserved heart function** after chemotherapy damage

([Bisi et al., 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10443692/))

## Dosing Protocols

> **Important:** These are research protocols, not medical advice.

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Dose range** | 1-3 mcg/kg (typically 100-300 mcg) |
| **Frequency** | 1-3x daily |
| **Route** | Subcutaneous injection |
| **Cycle length** | 2-4 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off |
| **Timing** | Fasted state (morning/evening) |

### Administration Tips

- **Rotate injection sites** (abdomen, thighs, upper arms)
- **Avoid food for 30 minutes** before/after dosing
- **Start low** (100 mcg) to assess tolerance

## Side Effects

### Common

| Side Effect | Frequency | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Hunger increase** | Very common | Ghrelin receptor effect |
| **Flushing/warmth** | Common | Lasts ~15 minutes |
| **Mild headache** | Occasional | Usually transient |

### Hormonal Effects

Hexarelin influences multiple hormones:

- **Growth hormone**  -  significant increase
- **IGF-1**  -  rises over time with repeated dosing
- **Cortisol**  -  moderate increase (~20-30%)
- **Prolactin**  -  mild increase (~10-15%)

## Hexarelin vs. Other GHRPs

| Feature | Hexarelin | GHRP-6 | Ipamorelin |
|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| **GH release potency** | Strongest | Moderate | Mild |
| **Hunger stimulation** | Moderate | Strong | Minimal |
| **Cardiac benefits** | Yes | No | No |
| **Cortisol increase** | Moderate | Mild | Minimal |
| **Desensitization risk** | High | Moderate | Low |

## Cycling Strategies

To prevent receptor desensitization:

- **2 weeks on / 2 weeks off**  -  conservative approach
- **3 weeks on / 3 weeks off**  -  balances efficacy and safety
- **4 weeks on / 4 weeks off**  -  for those sensitive to desensitization

## Legal Status

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **United States** | Research compound only |
| **European Union** | Prescription-only in some countries |
| **Australia** | Schedule 4 (prescription) |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does hexarelin compare to ipamorelin?

Hexarelin is more potent for GH release but has stronger side effects. Ipamorelin is milder with less hunger and cortisol impact.

### Does hexarelin cause weight gain?

The increased hunger can lead to weight gain if diet isn't controlled. The GH boost may help preserve muscle during fat loss.

### Is hexarelin safe for long-term use?

No long-term human studies exist. Cycling is recommended due to desensitization concerns.

### Can hexarelin be combined with other peptides?

Yes, commonly stacked with GHRH peptides like CJC-1295 for synergistic effects.

## The Bottom Line

Hexarelin offers unique benefits among GHRP peptides, particularly its cardiac protective effects. However, its strong hormonal impacts require careful dosing and cycling.
